- ba91ad5: Attach on an open-mode mesh, which never has a local seed

  `cotal attach` refused every seat on a mesh started with `cotal up --open`, saying it needed this
  space's local seed to redeem the session grant. An open-mode mesh has no seed by design, so the
  refusal fired on exactly the configuration attach exists to serve, and its remedy pointed at
  re-registering a root the mesh had already resolved correctly.

  How a session grant is redeemed is now the recorded mesh contract, carried as a value rather than
  inferred from whether a credential happens to be present. An open mesh redeems over the same bare
  connection the control round trip already used, and nothing is minted or synthesised for it. A
  static-auth mesh still mints a session-scoped credential from the seed at the root the mesh
  resolved to, and a static-auth mesh whose seed is missing still refuses, now naming
  restore-at-checkout rather than a re-registration that would change nothing. A user-auth mesh still
  refuses loud: two-step user-mode redemption is not wired.

- 6f248ac: Enumerate broker spawn sites so an unmigrated suite fails the gate instead of leaking

  The reaper claims a leaked `nats-server` by matching the store-dir token in its argv, and its header
  states the standing condition: it "is only ever as complete as the migration that mints the token".
  #1008 measured what that costs, 108 orphaned brokers on one box in a day, all holding loopback ports
  inside the OS ephemeral range that suites draw from. The five suites it named were migrated, and
  nothing was left behind that could notice the sixth.

  `pnpm smoke:broker-migration` is that missing piece. It names no filenames: it walks `git ls-files`,
  finds every call that starts a `nats-server`, and fails when one is not claimable by the reaper or
  killable by the teardown helper. A suite added next week is in the population on the commit that
  adds it. The census currently reads 319 spawn sites across 297 files, and the gate checks all 315
  that are in scope.

  The census found 98 unadopted sites, not five. Two conditions each break the chain on their own and
  both are now required: the token has to be in a path the broker is STARTED with, since the reaper
  reads argv and nothing else, and the handle has to reach `teardownOnSignal`, since the token only
  helps once the owner is dead. Three shapes were leaking for reasons a named list would never have
  surfaced. A suite minting a tokened store dir but launching with `-c <conf>` put the token somewhere
  argv never carries, so it was unclaimable despite looking migrated. Brokers started with neither
  `-sd` nor `-c` left no evidence at all; those now pass a tokened `-sd` purely as a marker, which
  `nats-server` accepts without JetStream and writes nothing into. And suites that owned one broker
  while leaving a sibling unowned read as clean under any file-level check, so ownership is decided per
  spawn site.

  A deliberate negative control opts out with a `SMOKE_BROKER_UNADOPTED_OK` marker, which is greppable
  and per-site rather than a silent exclusion: `reaper.smoke.ts` must be able to start an untokened
  broker, since that is the case it exists to detect.

  The teardown helper no longer stalls three seconds and then reports a false alarm on every green
  run. It waited on `process.kill(pid, 0)`, which keeps succeeding for a child that has been killed but
  not yet waited on, so a suite whose own `finally` kills the broker first left a zombie that read as
  alive until the deadline elapsed, and the helper then printed `did not exit before path cleanup`
  about a process that was already dead. Liveness now distinguishes a zombie from a running process,
  and a genuinely running broker is still waited on before its store dir is removed.

- 44cdcc2: Make the delivery daemon own its liveness record

  `delivery.<space>.pid` was written only by the CLI launcher, so a daemon started by any other route,
  a container entrypoint, systemd, or an operator running `cotal deliver --space <space>`, left
  whatever was on disk untouched and every reader believed it. On a reporting mesh the record named a
  pid that had been dead for four days while the daemon ran under a different one.

  That is not only an under-report. `cotal down` decides what to stop from the same record, and
  `mayBeRunning` is the guard that must fail closed so `cotal down nats` cannot take the broker away
  from a live dependant. A record naming a dead pid satisfies that guard: it supplies the
  proof-of-death the guard asks for, so a live delivery daemon reads as clear and the broker goes out
  from under it.

  The daemon now writes its own record and removes it, with the identity pin, when it exits. The write
  happens once the single-flight shard lease is held, and not before: a daemon that loses that lease
  refuses to bind and exits, so writing on entry would let a loser overwrite the live holder's record
  on its way out. It is written before the Plane-3 bind so an operator can still stop a daemon whose
  bind hangs; readiness is a separate fact the lease's own flag already carries.

  Readers no longer believe a pid merely because it is alive. The delivery record's liveness gains the
  `foreign` state the manager's already had, for the same reason: a record that outlived its daemon is
  eventually re-pointed at an unrelated process by pid reuse, and `kill(pid, 0)` alone reports that
  stranger as a healthy daemon forever. A live pid is trusted only once its command line has been read
  and names the daemon, and `cotal down` never signals a live process that is provably not one.
  Attribution only downgrades on proof, so a platform with no argv source, an unreadable process, or
  one that exits during the read all behave exactly as before.

- 6cc504b: Report an unbound delivery responder instead of a healthy-looking daemon

  A delivery daemon whose `ctl.delivery` responder has not bound blocks spawn, retirement and join,
  but no operator-facing surface said so. `cotal status` printed `delivery  running (pid N)` off the
  pidfile alone, which is the identical line it prints when delivery is fully healthy. The daemon's
  own readiness lease already distinguished the two, and `cotal status --components` already read it,
  but that pass is opt-in, so an operator watching the ordinary surfaces saw a green control plane
  while every lifecycle operation failed. The boot path made the same conflation from the other side:
  when the readiness wait elapsed, `cotal up` logged one info line promising that boot durable joins
  would reconcile and then reported success, so its caller could not tell a bound responder from an
  absent one.

  Bare `cotal status` now reads the same readiness lease `--components` reads, and reports the
  responder as bound, not bound, or unchecked. An unbound responder names its consequence in the same
  line: no spawn, no retirement, no join until it binds. Bare status remains a broad, recovery
  oriented diagnostic and still exits 0, and where the lease cannot be read it says the axis was not
  checked and points at `--components` rather than implying health.

  Readiness is judged against the daemon that is supposed to be serving, not merely against the flag.
  A daemon that dies without releasing its lease leaves its `ready` record in the bucket until the
  lease TTL expires it, so for that window a restarted or crashed mesh could still report a bound
  responder off the previous daemon's record. Both surfaces now compare the lease holder against the
  daemon this workspace launched and report a leftover record as not bound, naming it as a dead
  daemon's record that clears on its own. Where the holder genuinely cannot be known, such as an
  adopted daemon this process did not start, the holder is not checked and behaviour is unchanged.

  `cotal up` either binds the responder or states that it did not and what that prevents; the promise of a reconcile stays, but as
  a statement that the wait is open ended and that agents do not need respawning, rather than as the
  only thing said. A denied join now names the delivery daemon as a possible cause alongside
  credentials, instead of sending an operator holding valid credentials after the wrong hypothesis.

  `cotal doctor auth` no longer reports a healthy fleet as broken. When a daemon re-mints an agent's
  credential, the previous incarnation's file stays on disk, expired, and every one of those was
  reported as `EXPIRED - the broker denies this credential` with the remedy `respawn the agent`.
  Following that remedy destroys live sessions to repair nothing, because the running agent is already
  using its successor. Superseded incarnations are now recognised from the credential family that
  names them, reported as leftover files with a cleanup that is explicitly not a respawn, and excluded
  from the verdict, while a credential that genuinely has no successor is still a problem. The remedy
  for a recoverable credential now says that a running manager re-mints it and that the agent adopts
  the new file without being restarted; `respawn` is reserved for material no renewal pass can rescue.
  The doctor also names an unbound delivery responder when the recorded renewal pass hit one, so the
  surface an operator reaches for when credentials look wrong can say that credentials are not the
  fault.

- fc6f0b1: Scope an unanswered endpoint verdict to the rail the request rode

  A CLI whose caller carries an issued generation rides the versioned `ep.v1` rail. SPEC 13.15 makes
  that rail a separate subject space from the legacy `ep` rail and requires an endpoint to serve
  both, so a manager built before the versioned rail serves `ep` alone and never receives the
  request. The describe waited out its whole budget and every hosted `cotal run` verb reported that
  no manager answered on the endpoint rails, asked whether one was running, and offered `--local`,
  against a manager that was up, on the roster and answering `cotal ps` throughout. `--local` drives
  the run from the calling process and names the caller as the run's answerer, so an operator who
  took the suggestion would submit an answer under the wrong identity.

  The unanswered marker now carries the `ep` plane the request was published on, and `describe`
  names it in its own refusal. `cotal ps` and the other manager verbs state the reachability verdict
  against that rail instead of against the mesh, and say what silence on a versioned rail does not
  establish. `cotal run`'s hosted verbs do the same and drop both the question and the `--local`
  suggestion there, since neither follows from what was observed. On the legacy rail every message is
  unchanged: there is no second rail its silence could be hiding a manager on.

  No fallback describe is issued on the other rail. A caller holds broker rows for its own rail only,
  so the request would be refused at publish rather than answered.

- f4ddd02: Refuse to re-exec a detached daemon from an entry that is not the CLI

  `selfArgv()` builds the argv every detached re-exec is spawned with: `[node, ...loaderFlags,
process.argv[1]]`, plus a cotal subcommand the caller appends. It took `process.argv[1]` on trust.
  Under tsx that is whatever file was run, so a process started from something other than the `cotal`
  entry spawned a child that re-ran THAT file with `supervise`, `deliver` or `ext add` appended, which
  the file does not read. A test fixture reaching `ensureControlPlane` therefore spawned a copy of
  itself as its own manager, and the copy reached the same call and spawned the next: 970 detached
  generations over 4.7 hours on a persistent host, each holding a nats-server and a delivery holder.
  The guard cannot live in the test harness, because `startManagerDetached` unrefs its child on
  purpose and nothing can adopt it.

  `selfArgv()` now refuses unless the entry is the CLI's own composition root: `bin/cotal.ts` in a
  source checkout, `dist/cotal.js` in an install, or a bare `cotal`, which is what `npm i -g` leaves
  in `process.argv[1]` because it publishes the bin as a symlink. The refusal names the entry, says
  what a child spawned from it would actually run, and names the remedy. It is a throw rather than a
  skipped spawn: a re-exec that silently does not happen reports a healthy control plane over nothing.

  The manager, delivery and auth starters now build that argv before they open the daemon logfile, so
  a refused start leaves the mesh root exactly as it found it instead of creating a log and leaking
  its descriptor.

- 56afdaf: A seat is reported as not found only when every reachable manager instance answered for itself

  `cotal stop`, `cotal attach` and `cotal input` locate a seat by asking every registered manager
  instance which one hosts it, because a single manager answers `not-found` both for a seat it does
  not host and for a name that exists nowhere. That search concluded absence from every instance the
  scatter called reachable. An instance that answered with a REFUSAL is reachable, and it stated
  nothing about which seats it hosts; an instance that never answered at all was left out of the
  count entirely. So an incomplete search printed a definite negative that named the instance count,
  which is the shape a reader believes: a seat that `cotal ps` listed as running the whole time was
  reported as being on none of the reachable managers, and the same command with `--on <instance>`
  succeeded first time.

  Absence is now concluded only from instances that answered for themselves. When any registered
  instance stayed silent or refused the read, the verbs report that the seat's location could not be
  established, name those instances, and state that this is not a report that the seat is gone, so an
  operator or a retry loop pins with `--on` instead of concluding the seat is already gone. A search
  in which every instance answered still reports the seat as absent, unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 5e23b1d: Keep the versioned rail's subject token out of source comments

  The issued-profile census scans every shipped source for the versioned rail's subject token and
  allows only core's subject and grant builders to spell it. Five comments in core, the CLI and the
  runtime spelled the token and failed that cell on main. They now say "the versioned rail" or "the
  versioned plane". No code changes.

- 1112755: Give fresh setup defaults the run capability alongside spawn. Document workflow tool setup, credential refresh for existing personas, and supported authentication modes.
- 504e78f: Observe before writing: no seed store rewrite during parse, validation or a dry run

  `runCli` ran the connector-seeding boot gate before command lookup, flag parsing and the command
  body, so a newer staged binary invoked as `cotal down --preserve-state --dry-run` against a live
  older deployment rewrote the operator-global seed store, manifest and npm prefix to the new version
  and only then printed the usage refusal for the unsupported flag combination. No service stopped,
  yet the operator's next command from the older CLI failed on version skew: the machine was migrated
  by a run that refused to do anything. A `--dry-run` invocation now skips the auto-reconcile, so a
  run that promises to plan and print writes nothing, whether it goes on to render a plan or to
  reject the invocation.

  `executeUpdate` had the same shape one level down. `reconcileCurrent` ran `runSeed({force: true})`
  before `reportRunningManager`, so `cotal update --self` rewrote the store before it had read whether
  a manager was running or which mesh was the target; on a machine whose mesh predates this release's
  authority stores the run then failed its running-manager continuity check with the store already
  rewritten. The continuity check is a pure read of the running manager and the selected target, and
  now runs first: a failed or legacy verdict refuses with the seed store untouched.

## 0.49.0

### Minor Changes

- b0aeca4: Make bare `cotal down` and `Manager.stop()` spare managed agents by default. Use
  `cotal down --with-agents` or `Manager.stop({ withAgents: true })` for deliberate destructive
  teardown. Linux PTY seats release manager-local proxy custody while their detached custodians and
  child processes continue running, and the CLI binds destructive intent to the exact live stop
  attempt so an interrupted command cannot poison a later bare shutdown. Managers launched before
  process identity pins existed remain stoppable after the documented reduced-guarantee warning:
  bare down cannot prove which SIGTERM handler that running binary carries, so it never reports the
  pre-signal seat inventory as confirmed spared. A genuinely older destructive handler may still reap
  those agents. `--with-agents` uses a one-shot handoff bound to the manager pid and the live
  stop-reservation inode, then signals unconditionally.
- e3f2d21: Keep a dead `cotal up` mesh record as offline, with its root in the error

  A liveness miss used to delete every registry record that was not `origin: "manual"`, including
  `origin: "up"` and pre-origin records. `cotal meshes` was the command the error pointed at, and it
  was the command that destroyed the restart authority. The record was already written at provision
  time; this change stops withholding survival from it.

  `pruneMesh` is now reason-gated. `gone` (the liveness sweep, and preflight `unreachable`) keeps
  every origin as `offline`. `mismatch` (credentials rejected, open-now-auth, stale-auth-root) still
  drops an `up` record and still never drops a `manual` one. `cotal down` / `cotal clean all` still
  drop `up` records for the root they tear down.

  The unreachable copy for a kept `up` record still starts `no mesh running at <server>` and then
  names the recorded root, telling the operator to run `cotal up` there, so a bare `cotal up` in
  the wrong cwd cannot start a different mesh.

  A liveness sweep still returns `{ pruned, offline }`. Resolution now uses `offline`: a record
  known dead is not a live candidate for a bare command (`no mesh running` / `multiple meshes
running` name only meshes that answered). `--space` still resolves a dead record so preflight
  can name its root. All-offline is still `no-meshes`; the named-space path is what reports
  "recorded but not running".

### Patch Changes

- 0680a3f: Warn when `cotal up --detach` is launched by a systemd `Type=oneshot` unit with
  `RemainAfterExit=yes`, because that unit observes only the launcher's successful exit and can remain
  active after the detached stack dies. Document a foreground long-running unit, component-health
  checks, and split broker/manager monitoring.
- 062881a: Wire `--max-sessions` from the CLI into the manager's live-session ceiling.

  `ManagerOptions.maxSessions` was documented as deployment-configurable, but nothing in the CLI
  could set it, so every live manager sat at 64. `cotal supervise --max-sessions` and
  `cotal up --max-sessions` now parse a positive integer, pass it into the manager, and record it on
  the mesh so a same-root repair, resume, or `spawn -f` that restarts the manager does not silently
  drop a raised ceiling. A refresh of an already-running manager refuses a different `--max-sessions`
  rather than recording an unapplied setting. A capacity refusal names `--max-sessions`. Default
  remains 64. Size for agents × panes: the browser console opens one session per pane.

- 5079c89: Rebind a presence watch that goes silent under a live connection, and stop `cotal ps` from printing a liveness verdict while the manager's own presence view is stale.

  On netcup on 2026-09-09 the presence stream was deleted and recreated while the manager kept its
  connection. Its ordered consumer re-created itself from the old cursor against a stream whose
  sequence had restarted, the broker kept sending it idle heartbeats, and nothing ever re-created the
  watch. The manager's roster froze at the pre-recreation snapshot for hours: `cotal ps` printed
  `mesh offline` for every seat older than the freeze and `not in roster` for every seat younger,
  while a fresh observer saw all of them heartbeating. The lane watchdog stopped a working
  orchestrator twice on that reading.

  The endpoint's sweep already refused to age peers out while the whole bucket was silent and marked
  the view stale; that was the right verdict for a held link and the wrong end state for a dead
  consumer. When the view is stale and the transport is up, the endpoint now stops the old watch and
  binds a new one from the bucket's current state, once per liveness window, and reports the rebind
  as a warning that names the silent interval. The per-peer age-out also requires that the watch
  delivered for a full window after the peer's last heartbeat, so an observer's own deafness no longer
  emits one offline verdict per peer on the tick before the whole-bucket gate trips. A rebind that
  is still awaiting the broker when the endpoint stops or rebuilds its connection is retired: it
  installs nothing and reports nothing, so a stopped endpoint never regains a watch and a rebuilt
  one keeps the watch its fresh connection bound. A rebind that lands on a bucket with no keys is
  read two ways. An observer that does not register (a probe) learns that nobody is present: it
  retires every peer still in its roster and holds the view current until the first write, instead of
  reading its own silence as staleness and rebinding once per window while the mesh is empty. An
  observer that registers (the manager) is one of the missing keys, so the bucket was wiped since its
  last heartbeat: it re-publishes its own record, the new watch delivers it, and every other peer is
  re-observed or aged out from that delivery. It never marks itself offline on a current view.

  Each `ps` row now carries the manager's presence-view state (`meshView`: `current`, `stale`, or
  `unpopulated`), and the CLI prints `mesh unknown` with the reason instead of `mesh offline` or
  `not in roster` whenever that state is not `current`. Rows from an older manager carry no field and
  render as before.

- 1636927: Resume long manager re-registrations with fresh scoped authority and durable same-operation eviction progress, and document safe gate recovery and the last-resort JetStream store replacement procedure.
- 6836dd3: Allow `cotal send dm`, `msg`, and `ask` from an operator shell outside a managed seat. The transient
  sender now uses a fixed advisory display name while its wire principal continues to come from the
  resolved credential or user bearer.

## 0.47.0

### Patch Changes

- 8ec22cb: `cotal down` and `cotal describe` now dial with the TLS requirement the mesh record holds, instead
  of passing `tls: false` at every one of their three dials. On a mesh recorded `tls://`, `wss://` or
  added with `--tls`, those connections previously tolerated a plaintext broker; they now require the
  handshake, which is what the recorded requirement means everywhere else. This is fail-closed on
  `down`, a destructive command: a mesh recorded TLS-required whose broker answers plaintext now
  fails there. Target preflight already refuses that mesh one step earlier, so no reachable mesh
  changes behaviour.
- f3103b3: Refresh an explicitly named local space from its matching same-server registry record instead of a record chosen by registry order.
- cf294e7: Settle pending wait-exit after a real child exit, drop the redundant handle catch, keep launch-failed when backlog throws on a closed attach stream, bound manager control-rail disconnects after a broker exit, refresh the bundled custody docs, and grade ci-ok as the sole always-running aggregate plus both pack polarities.
- 8ec22cb: `cotal supervise` on a registered remote mesh now dials the broker URL the registry actually
  holds. A remote broker is commonly published over a `wss://` edge, and the manager-authority
  registration the supervisor runs first handed that URL to the raw node transport, which refuses a
  websocket URL outright, so supervision stopped before a manager was ever constructed. That
  registration and every other control dial this audit found can be handed a registry server URL now
  select the transport from the scheme, including the planes `cotal run --local` opens, which failed
  on such a mesh for the same reason. The registration also carries the record's TLS requirement
  instead of assuming a plaintext broker, so a participant no longer downgrades its prepare
  credential exchange on a mesh the registry describes as TLS-required. On the same path, the cluster
  artifacts the registration reads back are now looked up by the key form the content-addressed store
  uses, which a remote registration reached with a prefixed digest reference and could not resolve.

## 0.46.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d745af: Add the local durable runtime adoption seam and report legacy manager continuity before a running update can be described as hot. `Runtime.adopt` is optional: runtimes without durable custody omit it, and the manager refuses by name rather than requiring a throwing stub on every adapter. `cotal update --self` reports the selected manager before a global install and hands `--space` / `--server` / `--creds` to the replacement child.
- 18a0024: The manager hosts workflow runs. `run-start`, `run-resume`, `run-answer`, `run-status` and
  `run-ps` are served on the manager's endpoint rails; a run is validated before anything is
  recorded, driven in the manager's process under a per-run `run-driver` credential, and taken back
  from its journal after a manager restart. `cotal run` is a client of that surface by default,
  with `--local` keeping the in-process drive, now under the run's own `run-driver` and
  `run-operator` credentials rather than `admin`; an answer's writes are pinned to the one pause it
  answers. A user-auth mesh refuses the family by name until a run can carry its user's owner. A new `run` capability mints the family into an
  agent's credential and injects the `cotal_run` tool, so an agent can write a cotal-lang program
  and start it from a session. `run-answer` records the answerer from the caller's credential and
  takes no `by`; `cotal run answer` drops `--by` on the hosted path. `spawn({ supervise })` is a restart policy the manager enforces in
  place: `{ restarts, window? }` (default `10m`) until the budget is spent, then the seat is
  retired and the next `turn` is L4002. A policy this host cannot honour is refused at accept.

The refusal names `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` isolation, not the test-only `COTAL_ALLOW_CHECKOUT_SEED=1` override. An older CLI that meets a newer store is pointed at `cotal ext seed --force`, not `--reset`. `COTAL_HOME` does not relocate this store.

### Patch Changes

- 2850a5a: Count a smoke suite as gated only when a CI job actually runs it. join-external live coverage now rides its own live-job step; a duplicate connect classifier that only `pnpm check` reached is gone. Backup live suites stay UNGATED as already-red (#643 / #1285).

Isolate the send smoke's CLI subprocesses from the operator seed store (`HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `TMPDIR`, strip `COTAL_*`). In-tree callers that previously relied on a missing or ambient name now set that identity: `send.smoke.ts`, `user-auth-launch.smoke.ts`, `sys-rotation-e2e.smoke.ts`, `up-tls-routes-live.smoke.ts`, `backup-usermode-live.smoke.ts`, and `backup-faults-live.smoke.ts`. A child that inherited a seat's environment is still attributed as that seat.
- e5412a1: Add per-agent `cwd` to mesh manifests. Relative paths resolve on the manager host against its workspace, matching the imperative spawn option. The directory survives launch-spec validation and contributes to stale-entry detection without changing hashes for manifests that omit it.

  This implements the working-directory part of #963. Manifest session continuity remains separate work.

### Minor Changes

- dbd7d98: Keep agent-profile minting within one resolved mesh root.

  `cotal mint` now reads the persona ACL, loads the signing authority, and stores the default credential under the selected mesh root. If the current folder holds trust for a different space or account, it refuses before writing and names both roots instead of combining authority material from one root with persona policy from another.

- 96e1d54: Resolve the persona catalog from the target mesh rather than the current directory.

  `cotal personas` listed the personas of whatever directory it ran in, while `cotal spawn` launched from the mesh it resolves — so from one directory the two could name completely different sets, with neither saying anything was wrong. Every `cotal personas` subcommand now reads and writes the resolved mesh's catalog, which also makes `--space` and `--server` real for the listing rather than only for the live `--running` overlay: naming a mesh now moves the catalog, and an unresolvable target refuses instead of silently acting on another directory's files. `cotal spawn --role`/`--subscribe` and `cotal send msg`/`ask` complete from that same catalog.

  The library functions behind this (`personasDir`, `listPersonas`, `listPersonaNames`, `listDeclaredChannels`, `listDeclaredRoles`) now require an explicit root instead of defaulting to the current directory, so a caller that omits one fails to compile rather than answering about the wrong place.

- 5ec7feb: Pin every stack pidfile to its process's creation identity before teardown. `up` writes a sibling `<pidfile>.identity` containing the pid and process start where the OS reports one. Every stop path checks it before signalling: a reused pid or torn pin is refused and preserved, and rerunning after the process is stopped clears the stale record automatically. A live pre-pin record warns and proceeds so the first teardown after an upgrade still works; relaunching writes the pin and enables full match and mismatch protection.

### Patch Changes

- bc2f328: Seed personas into the catalog `cotal spawn` reads, and name that directory in the output.

  `cotal setup` wrote `.cotal/agents/default.md` under the directory it ran in, while `cotal spawn` loads its persona from the mesh it resolves. On a machine where those differ — a shell outside any project, plus a mesh whose root is elsewhere — setup created a file spawn would never open, so `no default persona yet - run cotal setup to seed one` survived running exactly the command it named. Setup now seeds into the resolved mesh's catalog, including when that mesh was registered against a brand-new directory with no `.cotal` in it yet.

  Every seed states its destination as an absolute path, and when the mesh's root is not the current directory both are shown, so the choice is visible rather than assumed. With no mesh running at all the current directory is still the answer — setup has to work before the first `cotal up` — but it says that it fell back and why. With several meshes running and none selected it refuses and asks you to pick, instead of choosing a root on your behalf.

  `cotal spawn`'s refusal now names the absolute directory it searched and the mesh that directory came from, so a persona that is missing from one catalog and present in another is diagnosable from the message itself.

- 7dab05c: `cotal status` now names the root behind every persona row, and flags the case where the folder you are standing in is not the one a bare `cotal spawn` will use.

  Status could print `personas  default` in green under "This Folder" while `cotal spawn` refused in the same second with "no default persona yet". Both were right about their own root and neither said which root that was: the folder's catalog is `<root>/.cotal/agents`, while spawn loads the resolved mesh's, and the two diverge whenever `cotal use`, a `--space`, or a registry entry points elsewhere. The personas status listed and the personas spawn could launch could be completely disjoint.

  When the two roots differ, status now names both, says what the spawn root actually offers, and drops the green from a `default` that will not launch. When they agree, the output stays as short as it was.

### Minor Changes

- 00ac9d9: manager: refuse a manager-role spawn of a persona without the spawn capability. A persona defined over the wire (`cotal_persona`) carries no `capabilities:` line (the write path is content-only by design), and `cotal_spawn` takes a free-form `role`, so a wire-defined persona could be spawned with `role: "manager"` and join presenting as a manager whose credential cannot reach the control plane, silently, until the seat first tried to seat a worker (issue #966). The manager now refuses that spawn at accept, before any provisioning, naming the remediation for both authors: an operator adds `capabilities: [spawn]` to the persona file; a peer-defined persona cannot declare capabilities and must ask an operator. The guard keys on the effective role (a spawn-time role override wins over the file's, mirroring existing precedence) and leaves every non-manager spawn untouched. `cotal_spawn`'s `role` argument documents the requirement. Capabilities remain non-declarable over the wire: the closed `define-persona` input schema is unchanged and still guarded by `smoke:persona-input-closed`.
- 9021896: Make the runtime pid/log namespace per-space. The manager and delivery daemon now record themselves
  as `.cotal/manager.<spaceKey>.pid`, `.cotal/manager.<spaceKey>.log`,
  `.cotal/manager.<spaceKey>.delivery-aware`, `.cotal/delivery.<spaceKey>.pid` and
  `.cotal/delivery.<spaceKey>.log`, through the same `{space}` expansion `auth-service.<spaceKey>.pid`
  already used. The five names were root-scoped constants, so one workspace root hosted one manager and
  one delivery daemon by filename: a second space booting in the same root overwrote the first space's
  record, and every reader of that file then answered about the wrong process. `status`, `down`, `up`,
  `clean` and `spawn -f` take the space they are answering about.

  Existing single-space meshes keep working across the upgrade. Reads admit a pre-segmentation
  root-scoped record while it is the only spelling present, byte-exact, so a `cotal down` still finds
  and stops a daemon started by the previous build instead of orphaning it. Writes are always the
  canonical space-keyed name, and each start reclaims a provably dead pre-upgrade record first, so an
  ordinary upgrade does not leave both spellings behind. A live pre-upgrade daemon is refused rather
  than overwritten, and both spellings present is reported as ambiguous rather than guessed.

  A folder-wide command reads its space off the runtime records the folder holds. `resolveRuntimeSpace`
  decodes the space out of the record filenames and prefers a space whose record is running over dead
  residue; two spaces running under one root throws and names both. The previous read came from the
  `.cotal/auth` account records, which an open mesh (`broker: { auth: false }`) never writes, so a bare
  `cotal down` in such a folder answered with the default space and walked past its own manager once the
  records became space-keyed.

  `MANAGER_PIDFILE` and `MANAGER_DELIVERY_AWARE_MARKER` move from `pid.ts` to `local-process.ts` and
  are now `{space}` templates; both are still exported from the package index. `RESERVED_COTAL_CHILDREN`
  no longer lists the five root-scoped runtime names.

### Patch Changes

- 283de1c: Identify the running CLI artifact in `cotal status` and show the compared versions for stale Claude skills.

- 1cb7042: Announce seed-store generation migrations and record the writer and timestamp for later downgrade refusals.
- 05d534b: Make guided setup enumerate every installed connector through the registry and derive PATH and plugin hints from connector declarations instead of connector names.
- 7e45495: Make every shipped endpoint consumer explicitly surface or ignore recoverable warnings so retry and renewal failures no longer disappear silently.
- e703873: Report connector harness availability at manager boot and expose resolved binary paths in status.
- 6b9525e: Point manager startup and failure guidance at the per-space logfile the detached manager actually writes.
- c09d750: Stop answering progress with presence. Textual working rows without an outside last-assistant observation render progress unknown, while heartbeat age remains explicitly labelled as liveness. The render-agnostic observation classifier lives in the workstation layer, not protocol core; compact presence-only glyphs make no progress claim. A stale observation overlays stalled Xm on still-fresh presence.
- 17046ac: Spawn failures return the lifecycle facts the manager already had (blocked op, head state, opId, remedy) instead of a connector timeout or opaque string.
- b7b932e: Point status skills rows at `cotal setup --skills`, with harness-native setup declared and implemented by connectors rather than the base CLI.

## 0.36.0

### Patch Changes

- 7c5995b: Key per-tenant material per space instead of per root. The five root-scoped kinds (the `$SYS` cred pair, `membership.json`, `membership-rw.creds`, `delivery.creds`) and every per-agent standing secret now live under `space.<hex>/` segments, migrated on first touch through one choke point that refuses — loudly, with an honest remedy — on any root it cannot show to hold a single tenant. `space rm`'s step-7 reaps land with their step-1 preconditions ahead of the verb itself. Also: the delivery daemon's `$SYS` repair advice now asks the guard instead of printing commands that refuse on the roots that need them, expired user bearers stop being re-presented on reconnect (with the retry bounded), and `agentSecretKeyForFile` takes the caller's space and checks the recorded path against it, so a stored path can no longer address another tenant's material.

## 0.35.0

### Minor Changes

- c5948e6: Seed the default persona with wildcard channel read and post ACLs while keeping its active
  subscription set empty. A fresh default agent can now join and create channels on demand without
  receiving every channel at boot. Repeat setup also upgrades the byte-exact legacy default while
  leaving every edited persona unchanged. The guided demo personas retain their existing `welcome`
  scope.

  This is a minor release because packages are pre-1.0 and the shipped security default broadens the
  default persona's broker-enforced publish authority. The connector-core bump ships the updated
  version-matched operator docs bundle.

- d457d7f: Show each managed seat's model and requested variant in the default `cotal ps` view, and expose Jcode's declared local model catalog without presenting configured effort tiers as provider-verified capabilities.

### Patch Changes

- 4919a53: Render the broker config from the validated tenant inventory, so `cotal up` on a root that holds several spaces keeps every sibling account trusted instead of silently evicting it, and refuses to render while any account record is unreadable.

## 0.34.0

### Minor Changes

- 22c3182: Honor the persona file's `agent:` frontmatter when picking the spawn harness. The key existed in
  half the fleet's personas but no code path read it: it swept into the verbatim `meta` bag, and both
  launch paths resolved the connector before the persona file was loaded, so `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT`
  silently beat a deliberate per-persona pin (a `jcode` persona ran `claude` with no complaint).

  The harness now resolves once, on every spawn path, as: explicit `--agent` flag > persona `agent:` >
  `COTAL_DEFAULT_AGENT` > the product default. That is the precedence `model:` and `variant:` already
  have, keeping the env var a _default_ rather than an override. On `--detach` the CLI now threads
  an explicit flag and the caller's environment default as separate control fields. The manager loads
  the persona file before resolving its connector and applies the same precedence while preserving
  the invoking operator's default when its own environment differs. A pin naming an unregistered
  connector fails the spawn loudly with the connector install hint (no silent fallback).

  `saveAgentFile` round-trips the field, so a runtime `cotal_persona` redefine preserves a pin.
  Docs updated (`agent-files.md`, `connectors.md`, `cli.md`, `config.md`).

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- ba74c84: An agent now reads only the channels it lists. An omitted or empty read set means **no channels**,
  where it previously meant `general`: the agent-file loader, the provisioner, the credential mint and
  the endpoint each defaulted an absent read set to `["general"]`, so any persona that simply did not
  mention channels was subscribed to `general` by code and had the matching channel read row baked
  into its credential.

  An agent on no channel is still a full mesh peer: it appears on the roster and sends and receives
  DMs and anycasts, and the same default-deny that already governed `allowPublish` now governs reads.
  An empty list and an omitted one mean the same thing, for both read keys. That has one consequence
  worth stating plainly: when **both** are omitted, `allowSubscribe` falls back to the read set and so
  resolves empty too, which leaves the agent unable to `cotal_join` a channel at runtime. Give it an
  explicit `allowSubscribe` if it should be able to join one later.

  With no concrete channel there is no default broadcast target, so a send with no explicit channel is
  refused with a message saying so, rather than resolving to `general`. Leaving your last channel is
  allowed and always was; the `cotal_leave` description said otherwise and now says what actually
  happens, including that the default send channel is gone until you join one.

  Migration: **list `general` explicitly if you want it.** A hand-written persona that relied on the
  old default needs `subscribe: [general]` added.

  This changes the default `cotal setup` install as well. The seeded `default_agent` carries
  `subscribe: []`, which used to resolve to `general` and now resolves to no channel; it keeps
  `allowSubscribe: [">"]`, so it can still `cotal_join` anything, it just no longer arrives on a
  channel it never asked for — which is what its own seed comment already described.

  Already-running agents are not narrowed retroactively: a live seat keeps the read ACL its credential
  was minted with, across renewal, until it is respawned.

Host-session markers such as CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION no longer leak into seats and silently disable transcript saving. The Claude connector declares CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (and the rest of claude's documented credential set) so a container seat still authenticates; spawn.env remains the explicit opt-in for extra names, including a host marker a persona has chosen to receive.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e673ff: Delivery daemon: the launcher stops dropping the transport, and stops reporting a daemon it did not start.

  Two independent defects let `cotal up` print a healthy control plane over one that was not there.

  **A same-root refresh relaunched the delivery daemon without TLS (#836).** `startDeliveryWithBroker`
  re-derived the transport from `<root>/.cotal/broker-policy.json` whenever its caller passed no
  `transport` — and the refresh path never passed one, even though it had already decided the same
  fact from the mesh-registry entry and reconciled it against the live listener's `INFO`. The two
  durable records are written by different paths, so on any root that records `tlsRequired` without
  holding a policy file (registered with `cotal meshes add --tls`, or a mesh predating the policy
  file) the daemon went out flagless against a TLS-required broker. Nothing looked wrong: the client
  still upgrades on the server's unauthenticated greeting. The daemon holds a standing credential and
  reconnects unattended, so that was a repeating exposure, not a one-shot. The transport requirement
  is now a required argument to `startDeliveryWithBroker`; the policy re-derivation is gone and every
  call site names its source.

  **A stale lease answered for a daemon that had already exited (#837).** `waitForDeliveryLease`
  accepted any `ready:true` lease. A daemon killed with `SIGKILL` never releases its lease, and the
  record survives for the rest of the bucket TTL — so a replacement that lost the single-flight CAS
  and exited was reported ready off the corpse's lease, and `up` exited 0 with no daemon running and a
  pidfile fronting a dead pid. `waitForDeliveryLease` now takes `holder` and waits for that daemon
  specifically (`undefined` only when adopting one that was already running, whose id is not knowable
  from the launcher). `ensureDelivery` passes the id of the daemon it launched, and a launch whose
  process is provably gone while holding no lease now fails loud, naming `.cotal/delivery.log`,
  instead of returning success.

  `waitForDeliveryLease` now requires `holder` — pass `undefined` for the previous behaviour.

### Patch Changes

- cc1f2e2: `cotal attach` now coalesces rapid wheel input and PTY redraw bursts, waits for local stdout drain
  before returning session credit, and automatically repaints the canonical terminal snapshot after an
  explicit backpressure drop. Session teardown also lets the distinct terminal reason drain before the
  unsequenced close control can overtake it. The bounded 64-frame rail window is unchanged.
- 656921b: Add `cotal status --components`, a fail-loud per-component health probe that distinguishes an absent process from a live component that is not serving. It reports manager lease/service reachability and explicit unavailable startup phase, delivery ready-lease plus renewal-adoption outcome, web PID-bound HTTP port reachability, and registered broker reachability.

### Patch Changes

- 9570a57: A remotely provisioned spawn now launches under the incarnation uid the mesh
  minted. The provisioning endpoint pre-creates the agent's lifecycle-keyed
  durables and writes the ledger row under ITS `lifecycleUid`, and the auth
  callout mints the agent's dm/dlv/chathist grants from that row — but the launch
  kept the locally minted uid, so the agent asked for durables its credential did
  not name and looped on bind violations, surfacing as "not connected to the
  mesh" while the broker showed publish violations on `$JS.API.CONSUMER.INFO`.
  The remote branch now adopts `material.lifecycleUid`, the same authority rule
  already applied to the returned subscribe/allow lists.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f025c3: `cotal spawn` works against a mesh registered from a remote bundle. A user-mode
  agent's credentials must be granted where the space's signer lives, so a laptop
  spawn previously refused with a message about missing local material. A mesh may
  now advertise an agent-provisioning endpoint in its discovery bundle
  (`cotal up --agent-provisioning-url <https://…>`, carried as
  `userAuth.endpoints.agentProvisioningUrl`); spawn POSTs the operator's login
  bearer there, lands the returned material 0600, and runs the same bearer
  preflight before launch. A remote mesh that advertises none now refuses by
  naming that fact and the operator's remedy, instead of blaming absent local
  state. The endpoint is https-only (it receives the login bearer) and redirects
  are refused, matching the registration fetch discipline.

  The login proof itself never crosses the CLI package: the provisioning POST is
  a new optional `AuthProvider.postAgentProvisioning` seam on core's provider
  interface, implemented by `@cotal-ai/auth` — the CLI keeps its no-auth-import
  boundary.

  Also fixes `finalizeUserBundleEndpoint`, which replaced the bundle's endpoints
  object and would have dropped any sibling field the composer set.

### Minor Changes

- 1f44ca6: Add an optional reverse-proxy-facing auth exchange listener with generated mesh discovery, credential-based public proof, isolated throttling, and `cotal up --user-auth` configuration.
- 86f6b10: Remove the implicit `general` channel floor: undeclared access now grants nothing

  An agent that declared no channel access used to fall back to `["general"]` for its
  active read set and read ACL. That floor was applied in seven places — the provisioner,
  the agent-file loader, the manager's spawn path, the CLI's `spawn`, the connector's
  config resolver, and the endpoint's own channel list — so an agent with no frontmatter
  silently joined a channel nobody had granted it.

  The fallback also could not see the credentials it was guessing against. On a manifest
  spawn the materialized persona carries no access frontmatter, so the connector fell back
  to `general` while the minted creds allowed only the manifest's channels; the broker then
  refused the subscription and the agent joined nothing, with no error naming the cause.
  `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE` forwarding was added to paper over exactly this.

  Undeclared read is now empty, matching the repo's no-fallbacks rule and the existing
  default-deny on `allowPublish`. `Endpoint.send()` throws instead of defaulting to
  `general` when the endpoint is on no concrete channel — a caller that never declared a
  channel now gets a loud error rather than a message delivered somewhere it never asked
  for.

  The seeded personas change with it: `default_agent` no longer auto-subscribes to
  `general` and no longer carries a wildcard post ACL (`allowPublish: [">"]` → `[]`,
  default-deny), and the demo personas move to their own `welcome` channel. Channels are
  implicit — created on first use — so no channel provisioning is required.

  Breaking for anyone relying on the implicit floor: an agent that read `general` without
  declaring it must now declare it.

- a84cb62: Saving a persona now requires it to name the channels it reads. `saveAgentFile` refuses a
  definition with no `subscribe`, `cotal personas new` takes a required `--subscribe` (pass
  an empty value for an agent reachable only by direct message and anycast), and a persona
  defined over the wire is created with an empty read set, since that path deliberately
  accepts no policy from its caller, and records that the caller was never offered the
  choice so a reader can tell it apart from a persona whose author chose no channels. Previously a saved persona with no read set inherited
  whatever default was current, so a file could grant a channel its author never chose and a
  later reader could not tell a deliberate silence from a forgotten field. An empty list is
  written rather than filled in, so the two stay distinguishable.
- 45db9f8: `cotal meshes add` can register a REMOTE mesh. `classifyJoinTarget` gains the `public-tls` reach: with recorded TLS strictness (`tlsRequired: true`) a hostname or public IP literal is registrable, because the TLS chain + hostname check — not the resolver — picks the peer; without it every verdict is unchanged, and RFC1918 stays refused in both modes. **The overlay consent gate no longer applies under required TLS.** `--allow-unencrypted-overlay` exists because an overlay address is only protected while its tunnel is up; with `--tls` (or a `tls://` scheme) the handshake proves the transport instead, so registering an overlay address now needs no flag, prompts for no acceptance, and records none — where previously every overlay registration demanded one. Without required TLS the gate is unchanged. TLS intent is now sourced (a `--tls` flag or a `tls://` scheme) and ENFORCED: the record carries it, the candidate probe honours it, and `meshes add tls://…` against a plaintext broker is a refusal rather than a silent plaintext dial. Remote user-auth registration is built but **fail-closed**: `cotal meshes add --mode user` refuses by default, naming the sequencing, because no connect path can consume a remote entry yet (the auth provider still refuses remote user-mode connects). It is enabled by the remote-exchange client work, which deletes both refusals together. Behind that fence the form is complete: `--mode user` takes its pinned trust supplied — `--user-auth-file <bundle.json>` or `--from <https://…/.well-known/cotal-mesh>` (fetched over HTTPS, pins displayed and confirmed) — verified against the pinned exchange's `/health` + `/jwks` and the broker's own auth-required refusal. Address classification canonicalizes EVERY legacy IPv4 spelling before any verdict. `inet_aton` — which the OS dialer and Node's resolver both accept — takes octal, hex and short forms, so `3232235786`, `0300.0250.01.012`, `0xC0A8010A`, `192.168.257` and `[::ffff:192.168.1.10]` are all the same private addresses that their dotted forms name, and each previously classified as a public hostname and registered while the dotted spelling was refused. They are now refused identically. **This changes verdicts for EVERY alternate spelling, not only private ranges:** a mapped loopback literal now classifies as `loopback`, a mapped overlay literal as `overlay` (so it answers to `--allow-unencrypted-overlay` and can carry a residual), and a mapped public literal as `public-tls` — each one previously fell through to whatever the unnormalized string happened to match. Anything that classified an address in a non-canonical spelling may therefore get a different, dotted-equivalent verdict now. Genuine hostnames are unaffected: a name that is not a valid IPv4 literal in any base (`09.0.0.1`, `999.1.1.1`, `1.2.3.4.5`) stays a hostname. The `--from` discovery fetch and the pinned-exchange probes refuse redirects instead of following them (a 302 can walk an HTTPS fetch onto plaintext or another host), require an `https://` endpoint, and perform no network I/O until the operator has consented to the address. Remote user entries record `userAuth.remote` and a 0600 `sentinelCredsPath` (the path, never the blob), and promote `endpoints.url` to pinned trust; `assertUserAuthInfo` fails loud on both.
- 200a93f: Enable remote user-auth mesh registration now that managed agents can consume the recorded pinned exchange and sentinel through the remote bearer client. Remove the temporary development-only registration hatch and its fail-closed sequencing refusal.
- 44738b2: A remotely-registered user mesh now connects with stock cotal end to end, including over a websocket broker address.

  `cotal meshes add <space> --from <url>` already landed a complete remote trust
  position (IdP pins, public exchange URL, sentinel creds); the auth provider now
  CONSUMES it at connect when no local user-auth material exists: login session →
  fresh IdP JWT → the pinned exchange's capless public face → bearer + the
  registration-landed sentinel. Nothing is discovered at connect time, the
  transport rule (HTTPS, loopback-literal http only, names get no exception) is
  checked before the IdP round trip, and every refusal names its exact remedy.

  Brokers published through an HTTPS edge are dialable as `wss://host/path`:
  core picks the websocket transport by scheme at every dial site (endpoint,
  reachability, probe), `hostPort` defaults ws/wss to the web's ports, and
  `join-target` classifies `wss://` as TLS-bearing (the handshake is the
  transport's own) while `ws://` gets exactly the plaintext fences `nats://`
  gets. The canonical server string keeps the URL path — behind an edge the
  path is part of the broker's address.

### Patch Changes

- b8ee849: Announce the operator-global seed-store payload write, and its deletions, on the provenance channel. `cotal up` and the built-in-connector reconcile re-seed `~/.config/cotal/seed/store/<version>`, which is a machine-wide action (shared by every space, project directory, and checkout on the machine, moved only by `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`), yet the store write was previously silent. It now emits a `wrote operator-global seed store payload` provenance line naming the path on each materialization, so re-seeding from a non-released checkout reads as the machine-wide write it is. The idempotent reuse path stays silent.

  The same reconcile also garbage-collects unreferenced store generations, and that was silent too. A new `removed` verb on the provenance channel names every directory the collector deletes, because a silent delete is worse than a silent write: the write at least leaves the thing it made, while the delete leaves nothing to notice. The announce rides stderr with no failure policy, so a closed stderr keeps the write and loses the line; that bound is stated at the call site and in the config reference, which also documents the isolation mechanism.

  The config reference that documents all of this ships inside the connector as well as in the docs tree, so the regenerated documentation bundle carries the same text: an agent asking `cotal_docs` for the configuration page now gets the announce, the removal announce, and the stderr bound along with everything else that page already said.

- 5db8641: Registration's exchange probe now pins the exchange's own issuer (`urn:cotal:auth:<space>`, derived from the bundle's `space`) instead of the IdP issuer. The auth daemon's `/health` reports its own token issuer, so pinning `userAuth.idp.issuer` made `cotal meshes add --from` refuse every bundle the daemon's public face generates. The user-bundle smoke pins the cli-side derivation against auth's `spaceIssuer` so the two cannot drift.
- 653c6cd: Accept a path on ws:// and wss:// --server URLs in `meshes add`. The public face legitimately advertises a path-carrying websocket broker address (`wss://host/mesh-ws` behind a reverse proxy) and the dial layer already honours it, but checkServer refused it as non-bare — so the face's own generated bundle could not be registered. nats:// and tls:// URLs stay bare.

### Minor Changes

- aa1fe5f: `cotal attach` redeems a session grant with the seed the mesh resolved, never one walked up from the current directory.

  Resolution picks a root from the mesh registry and connects with it; redemption then asked the current directory the same question and used whatever it answered. The two disagree on a real machine rather than in theory, because root detection accepts any directory named `.cotal` and `~/.cotal` exists on every install (the mesh registry lives there). A command run anywhere under `$HOME` outside a project therefore minted its per-session credential from the home directory's trust chain and presented it to a broker that trusts a different one, surfacing as a bare authorization failure that named nothing. The trust material the resolution already carries is now used directly, which is the rule the control layer states for its own re-mints.

  A cwd anchor holding a DIFFERENT chain for the same space is reported rather than obeyed: it cannot change what the command does, but staying silent about it is how the failure stayed a mystery. `@cotal-ai/workspace` gains `divergentCwdAnchor` for that comparison, which is silent on a second checkout of the same mesh and on a directory with no anchor at all.

  The report cannot end the command either. Taking the seed from the resolution stops the current directory choosing which chain is used; it does not by itself stop it ending the run, because the report reads the walked root before the mint and the loader refuses unreadable trust material loudly. A half-written `.cotal/auth/broker.json` anywhere up the walk aborted an attach that had just declared it was not using that root, and on the reconnecting path that fault was retried as though the link were down. A fault reading either root is now reported as nothing to say, which is the accurate answer rather than a fallback: the comparison needs two legible chains, so an unreadable walked root asserts nothing and an unreadable resolved root leaves nothing to compare against. Corruption in the root the command actually reads still surfaces from the path that reads it.

  When the resolved mesh genuinely holds no seed, the refusal now names what the command resolved: the broker and the root. The old sentence named neither the root nor the mesh.

### Minor Changes

- a087c2b: A spawned agent now inherits the operator's environment. A harness you installed and configured
  should behave under `cotal spawn` the way it behaves when you run it yourself, and the alternative
  was Cotal maintaining a list of inference vendors: every new provider needed a change in Cotal
  before it would work through a managed spawn. `MODEL_PROVIDER_KEYS` and the per-connector lists
  that extended it are gone, and Cotal no longer names an inference vendor anywhere in its source.

  Cotal still resets its own `COTAL_*` namespace before the child starts, keeping the machine-wide
  knobs (`COTAL_HOME`, the feedback set, the default-agent pair, the `*_BIN` overrides, the timing
  knobs). That reset is not configurable, because it is identity and not preference: a connector
  supplies the per-session names for each child and does so conditionally, so an inherited value is
  never overwritten and would hand an agent another agent's credential path, ACL, or lifecycle uid.
  The whole prefix is stripped rather than a named list, because which names a connector sets varies
  between connectors and a deny-list only ever names what its author remembered.

  To confine a spawned agent instead, declare `spawn.env` in the cotal config file. The child then
  gets a fixed OS allow-list plus exactly the names you list. An empty array is a real policy meaning
  the OS allow-list alone. Note what this does and does not buy: `HOME` is forwarded either way, so
  an agent with a shell reads `~/.aws` and `~/.ssh` regardless, and this protects only secrets that
  live nowhere but the environment.

### Patch Changes

- 3f1ee2f: `cotal ps --wide` / `--json`: surface the per-seat facts the manager already records. The agent row now carries the model pin (and variant), `cwd`, `pid`, spawner, and the owning manager's instance id and host, all optional so an unrecorded fact (no model pinned; a runtime that owns no real process) serializes absent, never fabricated. Bare `ps` output is unchanged; `--wide` prints one dim facts line under each seat; `--json` prints the manager's row verbatim, one object per line, with instance headers on stderr. No new collection path: every field was already held in the manager's spawn-time record.
- a7742a7: attach: own the keyboard whenever there is no session. Keystrokes typed at a terminal whose link
  has died are read and dropped instead of buffered, so nothing an operator types at a frozen screen
  is delivered to the agent by a reconnect they did not know had happened, Ctrl-C included. That now
  covers every gap in the loop: the waits, the attempts, the hand-back of a session that faulted on a
  link that is still up, and the first establishment, so a key struck before the very first attach
  comes up does not arrive at the agent when it does. The detach key is read across all of them, and
  a press that lands while a session is opening ends the attach rather than being swallowed by the
  handoff to that session's own reader. With stdin a pipe the old behaviour is kept on purpose, in
  every one of those windows rather than only the first: a script's input is buffered and delivered
  when the session opens, including across a reconnect, so a feed piped into an attach does not lose
  what was written while the link was down. `--no-reconnect` keeps the single-session behaviour
  everywhere.

  Also: a piped attach now gives the shell back when it detaches. `printf 'ls\n' | cotal attach --name
web --no-reconnect` printed `detached from web` and then held the process open, because nothing
  released the command's own claim on stdin on the way out. That release is made where there is
  something to release: a terminal and a pipe are sockets, while a stdin that is a file
  (`cotal attach --name web < seed.txt`, or a parent that spawns attach with stdin ignored) is not,
  and releasing it there raised `process.stdin.unref is not a function` on the way out.

  Also: a session that dies while it is still opening no longer leaves the keyboard unread. The
  window is one round trip wide, between the reconnect being announced and the session going live,
  and a link that dies inside it ended a session that had never taken the stream while the client
  paused it regardless, so the reader that was still installed read nothing for the whole backoff and
  everything typed at that frozen terminal was delivered to the agent when the next session opened.
  The stream is now paused only by a session that resumed it.

### Minor Changes

- 5634356: `cotal attach` re-establishes its session when the link dies, instead of leaving you with a dead terminal.

  An attach left alone while the laptop slept was gone by the time you came back, in one of two ways
  depending on how long the link was down. Shorter than the serving side's stall watchdog: the
  manager's rail keeps advancing its sequence into a subject nobody is subscribed to, and the session
  transport has no retention, so those frames are gone. The moment the client redials and its
  subscription is restored, the next frame lands far ahead of what the client expected, the rail
  faults, and the CLI exits with `mesh session transport error: gap` about a second after the network
  came back. Longer than the stall: the serving rail fills its window, stalls, ends the session and
  closes, and both of those notices are published while the client is disconnected, so neither is ever
  delivered. On redial the client is subscribed to a session nobody is serving and hangs there with no
  output, no honest end and no exit at all.

  `attach` now owns re-establishment rather than leaving it to the NATS layer. When the link breaks and
  you did not press the detach key, it prints `[cotal: connection lost, reconnecting]` on stderr, then
  asks the manager for a fresh grant, mints a fresh per-session credential, opens a fresh connection
  and a fresh session, prints `[cotal: reconnected]`, and carries on in the same raw-mode terminal.
  The manager repaints the seat's current screen through the path it already uses for any attach.
  Retries wait 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, then 30s, for as long as the seat exists, and the detach key is read
  during the waits between attempts, so a reconnect never traps you. Every attempt re-runs the manager's full authorization, so a
  reconnect cannot keep a revoked or expired grant alive: no grant is ever presented twice.

  Giving up always says why. A manager that refuses the attach exits non-zero with the manager's own
  message; a reconnect that finds the seat no longer there exits cleanly with `seat <name> is gone`. A
  refusal that could still pass, such as a manager at its session ceiling, is relayed in the manager's
  own words while the loop keeps trying, so waiting is never unexplained. Pressing the detach key, or
  the agent's process exiting while you are attached, ends the attach as before.

  Each reconnect also hands the abandoned session back to the manager, over the first link that can
  carry the message, so an attach that rides out several outages does not consume a session slot per
  outage. Nothing on the serving side reaps a session whose caller went away while the seat is quiet:
  the stall watchdog only arms once the send window fills, and an idle seat never fills it. The client
  is the only party that knows, so it says so, using the session's own credential, the only one
  scoped to that session's subjects. If it never gets a link that can carry the message, it says that
  instead, on exit. Every wait on a link that is dying is bounded, and the bound is real: the timer
  that enforces it is what keeps the process alive while a socket that will never answer is waited
  on. A link that stays UP and carries nothing, which is what a sleeping laptop looks like from the
  client, ends with the same clean exit and the same message as any other fault instead of the
  command aborting on a wait that never returned.

  `--no-reconnect` restores the single-session behaviour for scripts that want one run and one exit
  code.

  Under it, `@cotal-ai/workspace` separates a connect refusal from what is done about one. Resolving a
  mesh and its preflight answered every refusal by printing a sentence and ending the process, which is
  right for a person who just typed a command and wrong for a loop riding out a broker that is briefly
  unreachable. The decision now raises a `ConnectRefusal` carrying that exact sentence, and the
  `*OrExit` entry points are thin wrappers that print it and exit as before, so one place writes each
  message and the two forms cannot drift.

### Patch Changes

- 401f0d6: `cotal attach`: pressing the detach key during a reconnect gives the shell back at once, instead of
  at the end of the backoff rung.

  The detach itself was always immediate: the terminal came back and `detached from <seat>` printed a
  moment after the press. The process then stayed alive until the backoff wait it had already
  abandoned ran out. Losing a `Promise.race` does not stop a `setTimeout`, and the timer is ref'd, so
  node kept the command open to the end of the rung. On the 30s rung that is half a minute of a shell
  that has said it detached and will not give the prompt back. Measured before the fix: 27.0s from
  press to exit with the next attempt 26.9s away, and 8.3s with it 8.1s away, tracking the rung rather
  than any work being done; 0.1s after it.

### Minor Changes

- 57d3a57: A Claude session publishes a structured event plane, and the `tr-<name>` transcript mirror is
  retired

  A session launched with `cotal spawn --events` now actually publishes. The Claude connector maps
  its session records to structured events behind the same hook relay the mirror used to sit behind:
  run boundaries per turn, assistant text, reasoning, and each tool call with its arguments, its end
  and its result, written to a per-session write-ahead log before they go on the wire so a restart
  resumes at its cursor instead of replaying or skipping. Until now no connector constructed the
  emitter at all, so every event channel was empty.

  The `tr-<name>` mirror is removed in the same change rather than deprecated alongside it. Gone with
  it: the `--transcript` and `--no-transcript` flags on `cotal spawn`, the `transcript` field on the
  manager's spawn op and its service contract, `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT` and `COTAL_TRANSCRIPT_DEFAULT`,
  `LaunchOpts.transcript`, `Connector.transcriptChannel`, and the mirror in all three connectors that
  carried one.

  MIGRATION. If you read a `tr-<name>` channel, nothing publishes to it any more. A managed session no
  longer mirrors its prose there under any flag or environment variable, and a spawn that passes
  `--transcript` now fails on an unknown flag rather than being ignored. Read the session's event
  channel instead: launch with `--events` and subscribe to `events.<owner>.<actor>`, which is keyed on
  the session's principal. On a static mesh that is `events.local.<key>`, where the key is what the
  manager allocated and the spawn reply carries it as `id`; on a user-auth mesh it is
  `events.<your-owner>.<agent-name>`, where the actor half is the agent's own name. `connect-claude.md`
  gives both forms. `cotal console` and the web console render event frames directly. Unlike
  `tr-<name>`, you cannot simply subscribe: the plane needs an out-of-band grant, and the command for
  it is under "To let something read a plane" below.

  What you gain and what you lose, both stated. A tool call now arrives with its full arguments, its
  end and its result, in a vocabulary a program can read, where the mirror gave a truncated one-liner
  of glyph-prefixed text. What you lose is prompt text somebody else wrote: the mirror republished
  every prompt, and the event plane withholds the body of a turn the agent did not author, because
  republishing a peer's message onto a channel that peer may not read crosses an ACL boundary. A
  peer-authored turn still opens a run and still shows the work it caused. One stated limit on that,
  because the loss column is only useful if it is complete: a tool result is this session's own output
  and is republished, so peer text quoted inside one still reaches the wire. A cell in
  `agui-authorship.smoke.ts` holds that as a measured limit rather than leaving it to be discovered.

  A spawn may be granted the event plane of the agent it is creating, and no other. A spawn that names
  a different agent's event channel in `allowSubscribe` or `allowPublish` is refused at the door,
  because that channel carries the session's tool inputs and outputs. The same rule runs on a manager
  resume: a retained inventory naming another agent's event channel is refused rather than adopted.

  The rule reads a **concrete** channel, two principal tokens and nothing else. A pattern such as
  `events.<owner>.>` is not an event channel to it and passes untouched, governed by ordinary ACL
  authority. That is deliberate, since the pattern is the form an operator writes on purpose for an
  observer.

  To let something read a plane, grant it out of band. The refusal prints one command, spelled out in
  full, for the mesh it is running on. On a user-auth mesh:
  `cotal actor grant <reader> --owner <owner> --scope '' --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --allow-publish
''`, every field named because `actor grant` is an upsert of the whole row and an omitted flag is the
  wide default (`>` read, `>` post, `spawn,role:default` scope), not "leave it alone". On a static mesh there is no
  actor ledger for `actor grant` to write to, so mint the reader instead:
  `cotal mint watcher --profile agent --allow-subscribe '<channel>' --provision`, the agent profile and
  not the observer one, since `mint` reads `--allow-subscribe` only for that profile and refuses it off
  that profile.

  `cotal mint` now REFUSES `--allow-subscribe` / `--allow-publish` off the agent profile rather than
  ignoring them. Those profiles carry a FIXED read set, the chat plane for observer and the whole
  messaging plane for admin, so
  `--profile observer --allow-subscribe <one channel>` used to exit 0, print a success line, and hand
  out a credential that reads every channel in the space: an operator asking to narrow got the
  opposite, silently. `--role` and `--provision` were already refused there for the same reason. The
  rows in `cli.md` and the sentence in `build-a-client.md` now say the same thing.

### Minor Changes

- 4cf5f72: Give a session's structured event plane a way to be turned on, and a channel that names who is publishing.

  An agent can now be launched with `cotal spawn --events`, foreground or detached, which publishes
  that session's structured event stream, what it did rather than the prose it wrote, on a channel of
  its own so an external observer or UI can read it. Off by default. Nothing about an existing launch
  changes.

  **The channel is named after the principal, never the display name.** It is `events.<owner>.<actor>`,
  derived from the principal the manager actually allocated. A display name is UI convenience: this
  mesh permits two live agents to carry one, and the manager itself auto-numbers a collision, so a
  name-keyed channel would fuse two principals onto one subject and, in auth mode, would authorize both
  onto it from a value that identifies neither. The derivation is a single function on the connector
  contract, `eventChannel`, so the subject the manager grants and the subject the session publishes to
  cannot drift apart. A connector that does not implement it refuses `--events` before any provisioning
  rather than starting a session whose events have nowhere legal to land, and the refusal releases the
  name it had already reserved.

  **The flag and the grant are deliberately separate.** Holding publish rights on a channel is not a
  request to publish to it. An agent file or a manifest can hand-write anything into `allowPublish`, so
  if a grant could arm the plane, any author who could write an agent file could turn on a full
  transcript of another seat's tool inputs and outputs without ever touching the launch grammar. Only
  the launch arms the session; the grant is what makes the arming useful. `cotal_spawn`, the peer-facing
  tool, does not expose the option at all. That is the shape of the tool and not a control-plane refusal:
  the manager's spawn service op is a second door onto the same handler and still accepts the field,
  which is a pre-existing property of that door and is fenced separately.

  **The flag rides the whole launch path, including the record a restart reads.** It is on the
  foreground launch, the detached spawn payload, the manager service contract, and the resume document,
  so a manager restart brings an armed session back armed. The foreground path mints its own grant, from
  the principal it allocated, and passes the workspace root the emitter's write-ahead log needs: a
  session armed by one launch surface and not the other would be a flag that means two different
  things. A resume adopts the credential the spawn wrote rather than minting a new
  one, so what a restart can lose is the record: either the channel leaves `allowPublish`, or the
  arming flag does and the session returns holding publish rights it will never use, which reads as a
  working system with an empty panel. Both halves are now carried and both are asserted.

  **One behaviour change to state plainly.** The foreground launch now passes the mesh's root as the
  launch's workspace root, on every foreground spawn rather than only on an armed one, which is what the
  manager has always done. Two connectors already read that field and root their per-agent home at it:
  Codex, which puts its per-agent home under it, and OpenCode, which puts its database and its serve
  pidfile there. Both previously fell back to the directory the operator happened to run the command
  in. So a foreground Codex or OpenCode session moves its local state from that directory to the mesh
  root, which is where its detached counterpart has always put it. Operators who ran `cotal spawn` from
  somewhere other than the mesh root will find that session's state under the mesh root instead. The
  Claude connector reads the field only on an armed launch, and Hermes and pi do not read it at all.

  **Supporting pieces in the shared connector runtime.** The event vocabulary is exported from
  `@cotal-ai/connector-core` for the first time, so a connector can reach it by package name instead of
  by deep path. The emitter gained a way to close an open run out of band: a harness reports the end of
  a turn through a lifecycle hook that writes no record, so a record-sourced stream previously had no
  vehicle for a turn terminal. The closing frame is an ordinary frame with one exception, it republishes
  the source cursor unchanged, because advancing it would mark records consumed that were never mapped
  and leave a consumer no gap to notice it by. The emitter refuses to close while a message or a tool
  call is still open under the run, while a frame is still pending recovery, and after a halt.

  **One pre-existing limit this makes visible earlier.** In user mode the allocated actor is the display
  name, and principal tokens forbid `-`, which is reserved as the principal name form's separator. The
  manager's collision handling appends `-2`, so the second user-mode launch of any persona has never
  been principal-keyable; it already failed at the identity and provisioning sites. The event grant is
  derived before provisioning, so that launch now fails before it leaves a footprint rather than after.
  The underlying naming limit is unchanged and is not addressed here.

- 9c2412c: `cotal input --name <seat> --text <text> [--no-enter]` types one line into a running managed agent's terminal and returns, so a program can deliver a harness command (`/compact`, `/clear`, `/model`) without holding an `attach` stream open. It is backed by a new manager op `input`, which carries the same row shape and the same authorization as `attach` (capability `manager.lifecycle`, targeted, authz modes `owner` and `any`), takes `{text, enter?}` with the text verbatim up to 64KiB, and answers `{name, bytes}`. Enter is appended unless suppressed; nothing is echoed back. The manager's cluster document is revision 7, so a caller's `describe` sees the new command. `AgentHandle` gains an optional `write(data)`: the `pty` runtime implements it, and the external terminal runtimes (`tmux`, `cmux`, `orca`, `herdr`) do not own the child's input stream, so `input` refuses and names the runtime rather than dropping the keystroke. The command is granted only to operator credentials, in both modes, and NOT to the `spawn` capability that already carries `despawn` and `attach`. That placement is deliberate: an `attach` grant needs a `session-caller` credential to redeem and an agent profile cannot mint one, so `input` would be genuinely new authority rather than a restatement of `attach`, and the own-owner rule that bounds `despawn` covers every seat under an owner rather than only the ones a caller launched. Killing a peer is denial; typing into a peer is control of it. On a user-auth mesh `cotal input` therefore needs ledger scope `admin`, the scope `ps` already needs there.

### Patch Changes

- 2752fe7: Stop `cotal ps` waiting on registrations whose host is gone, and give those registrations an exit.

  A class scatter's gather has two exits: every frozen slot answered, or the deadline. The expected set
  is frozen from the service registry, which records registration rather than liveness, and an instance
  that crashes never deregisters, so its record goes on claiming a live instance for as long as the
  bucket exists. That leaves a slot which can never answer, which makes the first exit unreachable, so
  the deadline is paid in full on every scatter in the space, indefinitely. Measured on the laptop this
  was built against: `cotal ps` at 12.5s with one true corpse in the set, ending in a row that read
  `unreachable` for a machine that had been gone for weeks. There was no way to remove that record.
  Three things were wrong, one per layer, and all three are fixed here.

  **The scatter can now be told an instance is gone.** `epScatter` takes an optional `probeLiveness`
  hook and ends the gather once every frozen slot has either produced a valid reply or been affirmed
  gone. It moves the classification point and nothing else: an affirmed-gone slot is still `missing`,
  still surfaced, still not `complete`, and a straggler arriving after an early finish is still reported
  `late` rather than dropped. Only the verdict `gone` licenses anything; `live`, `unknown`, a hook that
  throws, and any value outside the closed set all leave the full deadline standing, so a broken probe
  degrades to exactly the previous behaviour rather than to a fast wrong answer. `epProbeInstanceInterest`
  supplies that verdict from the broker itself: a `describe` cast on the instance's own rail with the
  reserved no-responders sentinel as its reply-to, the same primitive and trust rule `epCall` already
  relies on. A serving incarnation subscribes its instance rail for every command it serves and every
  endpoint must serve `describe`, so silence on that rail is evidence of absence rather than absence of
  evidence. The reply is never read, so an instance whose describe is broken still reads as present.

  **And a probe is never a reason to still be running.** Against a live instance the probe is never
  answered, because the request is a cast and a responder must not reply to one, so its deadline timer
  runs the full budget on every healthy instance every time. Wired into `cotal ps` that was measured at
  four extra seconds after the last row was printed, on a mesh with no dead registration in it at all:
  12.8s with the probe against 8.8s with it switched off, same tree and same mesh. The timer is now
  unref'd, so a probe still settles `unknown` at its budget for anyone waiting on it and no longer holds
  the event loop open for a caller whose gather has already finished. The same measurement after the fix
  is 8.6s to 9.4s.

  **The probe belongs to the caller, not to the scatter.** Asking about an instance is a publish on that
  instance's rail, and a credential holding no row for it is refused by the broker asynchronously while
  the publish returns normally, so a refused probe is silent and silence is what a live but slow instance
  looks like. Core cannot tell those apart because core does not know what the credential carries. So
  `epScatterService` forwards a caller-supplied hook and never invents one, and the CLI supplies a closure
  that returns `unknown` without publishing for any id outside its pinned set, and reports a refusal the
  broker raises anyway instead of letting it expire into a timeout. That refusal is attributed to the
  instance its own subject names, parsed as an exact route token, so one refusal is never charged to a
  second frozen instance whose id happens to be a prefix of the refused one. `cotal ps` freezes the class on its
  first connection, re-mints an instrument pinned to exactly the frozen ids, and resolves and scatters on
  a second. `instancePinnedInstrumentCapabilities` accepts several ids as well as one; each still emits
  its own concrete rows, so no wildcard instance is minted and the existing boundary on instance
  addressing is unchanged.

  **A registration now has an exit, in two explicit routes.** A manager that stops cleanly deletes its own
  `svc` spec and status keys, so an instance that was shut down leaves no row behind; a manager that loses
  its lease still tears down fail-closed and deliberately does not deregister, because at that point it is
  not the authority on its own record. For the host that cannot cooperate, `cotal deregister-instance
--instance <id>` removes the record, on the same evidence the scatter acts on and no weaker: it asks the
  instance first and refuses if it answers, refuses if the probe could not run at all, refuses if the
  instance is merely quiet, and deletes both keys at the revisions it read only when the broker affirms
  that nothing is subscribed on that instance's own rail. Silence is never the evidence, because a wedged
  process still holds its subscriptions and an unanswered describe is what a dead host, a hung one and a
  slow one all look like. A dead process holds no subscription, so a real corpse still deletes. Nothing
  sweeps the registry on age or on silence. Registering over a deregistration tombstone now works on both
  keys, so a deregistered instance re-registers normally on its next start, with its epoch advancing.

  **Rows split by what was actually established.** A silent instance already printed as registered with
  no answer rather than as unreachable. Now that a probe exists, the four cases behind that one sentence
  are distinguished: a registration the broker affirms is gone says the registration is stale and prints
  the command that removes it, a probe that was refused and one that was never sent each say so, because
  both are facts about the command rather than about the instance, and asked-and-silent keeps the wording
  it has, since a slow host and a wedged one are the same observation.

  **And one layer down, the same shape.** The manager writes `.cotal/manager.pid` itself rather than
  having it written by whatever spawned it, so a supervisor started by a container entrypoint, by cron, or
  by hand is recorded like a detached `cotal up` is; the record is removed on a clean stop, and only while
  it still names that process. Every reader now verifies the recorded pid is alive and is a supervisor
  before trusting it, and a live pid that belongs to something else is reported as a stale record and
  never signalled.

  This does not help against an instance that is connected but not answering. A hung responder holds its
  subscriptions and is indistinguishable from a slow one, so it still costs the full deadline, which is
  the correct result, and the removal verb refuses it for the same reason rather than unregistering a
  process that is still running. A scatter with no probe wired behaves exactly as before.

## 0.20.0

### Patch Changes

- 4743594: `cotal ps` prints what the manager reports instead of folding it into one false word.

  Every row carried two facts, the process (`running` or `exited`, with its age) and the mesh presence, and the CLI printed only the second. A seat whose process has been up for two days but whose mesh session dropped rendered as `offline`, and a seat with no roster entry rendered as `starting...` regardless of age. Both are false statements about a live process. Rows now print both facts, `running 2d 10h  mesh offline`, so the reader can tell a fresh start from a seat that never joined, and a live process from a dead one.

  A registered manager instance that gives no answer within the deadline is no longer labelled `unreachable`, which is a network verdict the client does not hold; it prints `registered, no answer within the deadline` and says that a dead host never deregisters itself. `attach` and `stop` say the same instead of telling the operator to retry against an instance that may never answer.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- a1bc784: Display an agent event frame, and separate event channels from chat.

  An `ag-ui.frame` part carries no text part by design, so every surface that renders a message as
  flat text drew one as `[unrenderable part kind "ag-ui.frame"]`. A renderer now folds a frame's
  events into readable lines: streamed text and reasoning deltas accumulate into one line rather than
  one line each, a tool call reports its name, its arguments and its result, and a stream that ended
  without its terminator is flushed and marked truncated instead of being dropped. An event type this
  build does not know is named rather than skipped, because a skipped event is a hole in a transcript
  that still looks complete. It registers through the part-renderer seam, so the standard resolves it
  by the part's own kind and never learns what the vocabulary means.

  The renderer is loaded by the composition root rather than by a connector. Connectors are removable
  extensions materialized on demand, and no surface that renders imports one, so a provider that
  registered only inside a connector would be absent from every process that draws.

  The event channel's name and its classifier move into the standard, beside the frame's identity.
  Both are things a reader needs in order to recognise an agent's stream without knowing which adapter
  produced it, and the two surfaces that most need to classify cannot reach an extension package at
  all. The constructor is re-exported from its former home, so no caller changes.

  The classifier is now a derivation rather than a prefix test, and the two disagree on names a real
  mesh produces. Nothing reserves the `events.` prefix, so a channel a human created and talks on
  answered yes to "does this start with `events.`" and was swept out of the chat pane it was sent to.
  A name that does not resolve to a principal is no longer treated as machine traffic, which returns
  those channels to the view, and leaves a malformed publisher visible rather than hidden. The
  collision is narrowed rather than closed: a chat channel whose remainder is itself principal shaped
  is still indistinguishable from an agent's stream, and closing that means reserving the prefix on
  the wire.

  The console keeps event channels out of the channel strip and out of the history prefill. The order
  matters more than the result: the channel list carries one entry per retained subject, so filtering
  after the fetch would read history for every event channel and discard it, which is unbounded work
  to display nothing. Live rows are marked rather than dropped, because hiding them would delete the
  only traffic this change taught the console to draw.

  The dashboard gains the same rendering through a per-kind lookup, so its dispatcher stays ignorant
  of every kind anyone teaches it. A renderer that throws, returns a non-string, or shares a name with
  an inherited object method is reported by name instead of blanking the body. The browser cannot
  import the shared renderer, so the two implementations are held together by an executable
  equivalence check rather than by intent.

  The example harness records a message through the shared renderer instead of keeping only its text
  parts, so a message whose content is not text is no longer written to the transcript as an empty
  string and scored as an agent that said nothing.

  No connector emits a frame yet, and no transcript mirror is removed. Display lands first on purpose:
  a cutover shipped before a renderer would replace a readable mirror with a part every surface shows
  as a marker.

- a7267b3: Refuse a class-queue split before the command runs, instead of reporting it afterwards.

  An endpoint call resolves one incarnation and then invokes through a queue that may pick another.
  Until now the caller was the only party that noticed: the mismatch was detected on the reply, by
  which time the responder had already handled the request. That is why the error had to say it
  proved nothing about whether the command ran: a check that runs after the effect is a report, not
  a guard. In a multi-manager space it is how one spawn becomes several: the effect lands on A, the
  caller bound to B is told the call failed, and the retry duplicates it.

  A request now carries the incarnation the caller resolved against (`bind`, a new optional
  `EndpointRequest` field), and a responder that is not that incarnation refuses at the pre-effect
  seam, before args validation, before target resolution, and before the governed gate that can
  consume a one-use payment proof. The refusal carries `ai.cotal.ep.bind-refused` and states that
  the command did not run, so re-resolving and re-issuing is safe. `failed-precondition` when a
  different instance received it, `expired` when the same instance is at another epoch: the epoch is
  carried even on the instance rail, where the subject grammar has no token for it and a successor
  incarnation would otherwise serve its predecessor's caller.

  The block confers nothing. It can only make a responder the subject already reached refuse, so it
  narrows and never widens, and attribution still comes from the reply subject: a refusal
  attributed to the very incarnation the caller bound is incoherent and is rejected rather than
  honored, so the marker cannot be used to claim an effect away. It is refused rather than ignored
  where it has no reading: on `describe`, which is what produces a bind, and on the scatter rail,
  which addresses every incarnation by construction.

  A long-lived client recovers from the refusal instead of stranding on it. `invokeService` caches
  its resolve, and its existing split recovery keyed on a thrown marker, which a refusal, being an
  ordinary reply, never raises. It now keys on the reply too, drops the stale bind, and re-issues
  the call **once for any command**, not only for one on the repeat-safe allowlist. That allowlist
  exists because a split used to be detected after the responder had handled the request, so core
  could not tell a duplicate-able effect from a repaired one and had to fail closed; a bind refusal
  removes the uncertainty rather than working around it, so the re-issue is a first attempt.

  The allowlist still governs everything else, and that is the half that keeps this safe. A
  responder that predates the fence ignores the field and executes, so its reply proves nothing
  about whether the command ran, and re-issuing on it would duplicate the effect. The re-issue is
  therefore withheld from every reply that does not carry the refusal, and the refusal is checked
  rather than believed: the bind it was computed against must be the one this request carried, and
  the incarnation it claims to be must be the one the reply subject attributes it to. Both halves
  are derivable by the caller, and neither is something an unfenced responder can produce by
  accident. A refusal that fails either is `internal`, not a licence to try again.

  A re-issue that cannot be resolved surfaces the refusal, not the resolve. Re-resolving goes back
  to the registry, and an endpoint that has since retired answers nothing, so a stale handle used
  to be met with a describe deadline ten seconds later, with the one fact that said the command had
  not run discarded on the way. The refusal now surfaces, carrying its marker, with the resolve
  failure named as the reason the repair could not be attempted.

  That recovery is counted, and the counter is the point. Handling a split makes it invisible, and
  the routing event is the only evidence the split exists at all; silence it and the split rate
  becomes unmeasurable exactly as it becomes survivable. `CotalEndpoint.splitRecoveryCount` is
  always on and never behind a flag, and a `split-recovered` event carries the same fact for anyone
  listening; the event can be missed, the count cannot. On a live two-manager mesh, 5 of 6 unpinned
  class-anycast reads split, so this is not a rare-event counter.

  The caller-side check remains, and remains necessary: a responder that predates the fence ignores
  the field and executes, which leaves the older after-the-fact report, and the allowlist, as the
  only protection in a skewed pair. That pair is now driven directly rather than argued about, by a
  hand-rolled responder that answers the class rail without a fence; `serveEndpoint` cannot produce
  the case, because its fence refuses a mismatched bind before the handler, so a request it executes
  is one whose bind matched. `--on` still addresses a specific manager, but it is no longer what
  stands between a split and a duplicated effect.

  The suites count executions at the responder rather than publishes at the caller, and the change
  was forced. "One publish" meant "one execution" only while a split was caught after the responder
  had handled the request; under the fence the second publish carries the first execution, so the
  old instrument reports a correctly repaired call and a duplicated one identically. Where a claim
  narrowed, the cell says which condition moved it rather than being replaced.

  SPEC §13.2 and §13.3 carry the normative rules; `docs/control-surface.md` is updated.

- 7f83b8c: `cotal mint --provision` (agent profile) pre-creates the identity's bind-only DM/deliver durables and its role's task queue on the live mesh, so a credential minted out of band can consume rather than only publish; `--role <role>` names the anycast queue, and `--space`/`--server` pick the mesh. The command now prints the identity's principal and lifecycle uid, the two facts a consuming client needs beyond the file.

### Patch Changes

- 87c4130: Say what a refused publish, a goal deadline, and a class-queue split actually proved.

  A refused publish now reports itself. `nc.publish` is fire-and-forget: a caller whose credential
  does not authorize the subject gets an asynchronous answer on the _connection_, so the publish
  returns normally and the only observable is that no reply arrives. That is indistinguishable from
  an absent responder, though the two need opposite responses: mint the grant, or go find the
  responder. An instance-addressed describe made with a class-rail credential is exactly that case,
  and it read as an unresponsive manager: measured live, `ps --on <instance>` returned `no describe
reply from manager within 10000ms` against a 115ms RTT while an untargeted describe answered from
  either instance in well under a second. The describe now watches its connection for a permission
  violation on its own subject and raises `permission-denied` naming that subject, the instance rail,
  and the fact that the responder may be perfectly healthy. The watch closes its status iterator on
  every exit, so it does not leave a listener parked on the connection per resolve.

  A goal that produced no terminal in time no longer implies the goal failed. It was accepted; only
  its terminal did not arrive within the wait. Observed live: seats that reported this had already
  come up and were messaging peers, and retrying submitted a second goal that duplicated the effect.
  The message now says the deadline is on the wait rather than the work, and says not to retry on it
  alone.

  An unpinned class-queue split no longer implies the effect did not land. Describe and invoke are
  separate trips through the same anycast queue, so in a multi-instance space the instance that won
  the queue received the request and may have executed it, possibly after the error was raised. The
  core message now says so and points at `ps`/`inspect`/roster before any retry; it stops at "a call
  that addresses one instance does not split". The CLI adds `--on <instance>` as the remedy, and only
  on the commands that have the flag (`ps`, `stop`, `attach`, `spawn --detach`), which declare it to
  the shared renderer; `models`, `up` and `down` ride the same rails and split the same way, and are
  no longer told to type a flag they do not have. Absence of a pin is not evidence of the flag.

  And a split is no longer silently retried into a duplicate effect. The client recovered from
  `failed-precondition` by dropping its cached resolve and invoking again, which is a repair when the
  bound incarnation is gone but a second attempt when the error came from a different live instance
  answering the class queue: request received and answered (executed or refused; the reply does not
  say which), error raised afterwards. Re-invoking there re-issued the command automatically, while
  the error text told the operator not to retry; it is the mechanism behind one spawn producing
  several seats. The retry now happens only for commands
  whose second execution is observably indistinguishable from one: the reads and `describe`. Every
  other command surfaces the split to its caller, carrying a marker that says a responder did answer
  the request, so the caller can check before deciding. Surfacing also drops the stale bind: the
  cached resolve named an incarnation a different live instance has just answered for, and keeping it
  would send every later deliberate call on that endpoint into the same refusal, so the caller could
  verify and still never reach the live instance. Dropping it re-issues nothing; the next call is the
  caller's own.

  The same rule now covers the adjacent case, a manager restarted in the same workspace root. That
  restart keeps the logical instance id and advances its epoch, so a client that resolved before it
  gets its next answer from the same id at a later epoch: `expired`, raised after the attributed reply
  just like the split. It used to be rethrown untouched with the bind kept, so a long-lived client
  (a connector's mesh agent, the console) reached the successor on every later call, may have applied
  the effect each time, and never recovered. The stale-epoch refusal now carries the same
  responder-answered marker, the guard keys on the marker rather than the error code, and its message
  says which side is stale: a responder ahead of what the caller holds is a successor (re-resolve to
  adopt it), one behind is a superseded incarnation still answering. The old text called the caller's
  own bound epoch the responder's "current" epoch, which named the wrong side.

  That classification is an allowlist and fails closed at both levels. It is keyed by endpoint, not by
  bare command name, because the client is endpoint-agnostic and a flat list would lend the manager's
  judgement to any endpoint that happened to reuse a name; an endpoint nobody has classified has no
  repeat-safe commands, and an unlisted command is surfaced rather than repeated. `describe` is the one
  exception, and structurally so: it is served by the machinery on every endpoint and can never be
  redefined into something that mutates.

  `models` is deliberately not on that list even though it is a read command. With `{refresh: true}` it
  reaches the connector's model listing and, for OpenCode, re-fetches provider catalogs and rewrites a
  cache: the same name, in the same grant class, answering differently because of an argument the
  classification cannot see. A long-lived client invoking `models` through `invokeService` therefore
  surfaces a split rather than absorbing it in a multi-instance space; encoding per-command argument
  rules here would reintroduce exactly the fail-open shape this replaced.

  Where this table bites, precisely: it is read only by `CotalEndpoint.invokeService`, the long-lived
  client path. Its shipped callers are the connector's `cotal_*` manager tools (spawn, inspect, stop,
  despawn, purge, define-persona), `cotal spawn -f` (launch) and `cotal down -f` (despawn), whose
  splits now surface instead of being re-issued, plus the repeat-safe `ps` reads of `spawn -f`,
  `down -f` and the console, which keep absorbing them. The one-shot CLI commands (`cotal ps`,
  `cotal models`, `stop`, `attach`, `spawn --detach`) resolve fresh and invoke once on a short-lived
  connection; they had no cached bind and no retry, and are unchanged. That is the clearest statement of what the list is: a client-side
  stand-in for `effect` (SPEC 13.7), which the wire now carries and this change does not yet consult.
  The spec grew both halves after this work began: `effect` declares whether repeating a command is
  safe, and rides `protocol.v: 2`, while this tree still registers and resolves at `v: 1`, under which
  every command reads as a write. Reconciling the two is a separate change and is named here rather
  than described as absent from the wire.

  The CLI no longer prefixes every failed manager call with "no manager reachable on the ep rails".
  That verdict is stated only where the call went unanswered, as core marks it: no responder, or the
  reply deadline elapsed with nothing attributed to the request. The catalog code alone was not
  evidence of that. A manager that answers its describe with `ok:false` has the refusal rethrown under
  its own code, `unavailable` included, and a store read after an answered describe raises the same
  code; both printed as an unreachable manager while a manager was answering (reproduced live during
  review). Core now sets a detail kind on the producers that observed silence and the CLI keys on it,
  never on the code. A registry read on the caller's own side (the scatter's freeze or its reconcile)
  is a third outcome with its own line, since the managers were not the failure and may all be up. A
  refusal that states its own cause (a describe refused by the broker, a split, a stale epoch) is
  printed as it is, because the prefix contradicted it, and an unanswered `--on <instance>` names the
  instance that did not answer instead of pronouncing on the mesh (measured: three managers answering,
  one typo in `--on`, "no manager reachable"). `up`'s resume readiness poll keys on that same
  unanswered fact rather than on the message prefix.

  `ps` prints the full instance id in its multi-manager view. That view appears only where the split
  makes `--on <instance>` the one way to address a manager, and `--on` accepts nothing but the whole
  26-32 character lifecycle token, so an abbreviated header named the remedy and withheld the value
  it needed, and `--on <prefix>` was refused as a malformed token. The `stop`/`attach` seat-lookup
  miss, which lists the instances that did not answer for the same purpose, prints them whole too and
  says the id must be passed as printed. `spawn` refuses `--on` outside a detached imperative spawn: a
  foreground spawn has no manager to pin and a manifest deploy launches through the manager class
  queue, so the flag was accepted there and silently ignored. An empty `--on` (`--on ""`, an unset
  shell variable) is refused at the flag on all four commands: `ps` and the detached `spawn` carried it
  to the mint, which refused it as an invalid token, while `stop` and `attach` read it as absent and
  fell through to the seat lookup, so one input had two answers and one of them was a dropped pin.

  The peer-side manager tools stop reading silence off the catalog code too. `MeshAgent`'s manager
  invoke reported "no responder answered - a manager may be down, or this credential holds no <cmd>
  capability and the broker denied the request" for every `deadline-exceeded`, and the bare code for
  everything else. That was wrong in both directions. The broker's no-responders 503 arrives as
  `unavailable` carrying the unanswered marker, so the one case where the capability explanation is
  certain was the one case that did not get it: an agent denied a capability was told only
  "unavailable". And an answered `ok:false` describe is also `unavailable`, deliberately unmarked
  because a manager did answer -- and this surface is read by agents, where a claim of silence invites
  the retry that duplicates a spawn. Same code, opposite conditions, separated only by the marker,
  which is now what the verdict keys on.

- 007a17b: `cotal up` now provisions the data-account half of the membership bundle on every run, not only when a space is first created, so a space provisioned before broker-sourced membership gains the graph feed without regenerating its auth. The delivery daemon's incomplete-bundle message now names the repair that matches the missing piece instead of always pointing at a system-account rotation.
- eae512e: `cotal mint --profile agent` now mints the lifecycle uid the agent profile requires, instead of failing on every invocation. The agent arm of `permissionsFor` builds lifecycle-keyed dm/dlv/chathist grants and threw without one, so the default profile could never be used and the only reachable profiles were observer and admin, neither of which can publish to a channel.
- 12f2df8: Refuse to stamp the connector seed store down to an older generation. A cotal older than the store's
  stamped generation used to miss the fast path, refresh nothing, and then write its own version over
  the stamp, leaving the store claiming a generation whose payloads were not the ones installed and
  making the next newer command reinstall every connector. It now fails loud before writing anything,
  naming both generations and pointing at `cotal ext seed --reset`.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- b519e73: Add the Herdr integration: a new `@cotal-ai/herdr` extension with a self-registering `herdr` Runtime provider that spawns managed agents into panes of a dedicated named Herdr session (`cotal-<space>`), where the Herdr server owns them — so they survive the manager's terminal going away. Requires herdr >= 0.8.0, enforced by a version check rather than a bare binary probe, so an older herdr reports the runtime as unavailable instead of advertising it and then failing every spawn.

  Each agent gets its own workspace and name-labeled tab by default (`COTAL_HERDR_LAYOUT=split` folds them into one shared tab). A spawn is `workspace create` + `pane run "exec …"`, then a bounded wait on the real process table — `pane run` types into a shell, so a delivered keystroke is not proof that anything started. The `exec` is load-bearing: without it the pane's shell outlives the agent and no exit could be proven. Lifecycle is keyed by Herdr's stable `terminal_id` with the public pane id re-resolved per operation off the session-wide pane inventory; creds ride an owner-only launcher script, never herdr's command line or its native `--env` (which lands in pane scrollback); every CLI call is scoped with `--session`.

  Spawned agents do not appear in Herdr's Agents sidebar: 0.8.0 reserves that registry for recognized agent kinds attached to an existing pane, so an arbitrary launcher is never one. They are identified by tab label and a `cotal` metadata token on the pane.

  The CLI lists `herdr` among the official runtimes (`cotal runtimes`, `cotal ext add @cotal-ai/herdr`), and CI now installs herdr so the extension's smoke suite actually gates rather than silently skipping.

- 665b378: Gate which broker addresses a mesh may be registered at, and make the unsafe one an explicit choice.

  Registering a mesh is how a machine starts sending agent credentials to a broker it does not run,
  and nothing here can require an encrypted connection yet. NATS announces itself in plaintext
  before anyone authenticates, so an attacker on the path can pose as the broker and read the
  credential straight out of the connect; a `tls://` URL does not prevent it, because it is the
  connect options rather than the scheme that make the client insist on TLS.

  `cotal meshes add` therefore gates on the address. Loopback literals (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`) are
  permitted because nothing leaves the machine. Private-overlay literals (`100.64.0.0/10`,
  `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`) require `--allow-unencrypted-overlay`, an explicit acceptance that is
  recorded on the mesh entry: they ride an encrypted tunnel only while that tunnel is actually up,
  and with it down the range is ordinary carrier-grade NAT that hostile routing can answer. A
  printed warning was not enough — stderr is not read by scripts, and it was not persisted, so
  nothing repeated it at the dials that followed. Everything else is refused, including ordinary
  private ranges such as `10.x` and `192.168.x` — a café network is private too, and private is not
  the same as yours.

  Registering an authenticated mesh also copies that mesh's `.cotal/auth`, which carries the space's
  account **signing seed**: a machine holding it can mint any identity in the space until the signing
  key is rotated and every credential re-minted. The docs and the guided form now say so where the
  operator reads them, and `cotal mint` alone does not substitute (registration needs signing
  material that composes).

  **Scope, stated precisely so this is not read as more.** This gates NEW REGISTRATIONS, and only
  those. It is not a client-side dial fence: a record written before this change, or a `--server`
  override, reaches the broker through the ordinary connect path without consulting it. Calling the
  join path "protected" or "made safe" would be wrong. Fencing the credential-bearing dial itself
  is separate work.

  Hostnames are refused as well, even ones that resolve somewhere permitted, because otherwise
  whoever answers the lookup decides which machine receives the credentials. The check runs before
  `--force`, which exists for a mesh that is temporarily down and never waives it.

### Minor Changes

- 975cad1: Give each space an artifact object store, with a real size limit.

  The `artifact` message part references bytes that live outside the message; this is where they live.
  Every space now gets a JetStream Object Store alongside its other streams, created by the same setup
  that creates them and removed by the same teardown.

  It carries an explicit 4 GiB cap, which is the point rather than a detail. A fresh object store ships
  unlimited, and a space's account is provisioned with unlimited disk, so "the account limit bounds it"
  would have bounded nothing — artifacts could grow until the disk did, starving the chat and delivery
  streams sharing it. Reaching the cap refuses the write instead of evicting older objects, so a
  reference published yesterday cannot quietly stop resolving.

  A space resource has to be listed in five separate places — created, deleted, granted, enumerated for
  backup, and recreated on restore — and being in four of them is the failure that reads as correct.
  Excluding the store from backups does not mean restore skips it: restore rebuilds every excluded
  resource and then asserts each one exists, so a store left out would fail a restore rather than
  quietly come back missing. The store is excluded under its own class rather than borrowed from an
  existing one, because artifact bytes are neither transient, derived, nor a lease, and calling them
  derived would suggest something could recompute them.

  Two smokes join the gate. One proves the store against a real broker by enumerating what the broker
  actually holds — created, matching the inventory exactly, carrying its cap, and gone after teardown —
  because create and delete are claims about a broker and cannot be checked any other way. The second
  was already in the repository, asserting the stream inventory, and no script had ever run it; it is
  now registered and gated, and it fails correctly on this change.

- c76a49d: Add the `artifact` message part: a reference to bytes too large to send.

  Every Cotal message rides one NATS message under the broker's maximum payload, so moving a file
  between agents has meant pasting bytes into chat until it breaks, or sharing a filesystem path that
  stops working the moment two agents are not on the same machine. SPEC §5 reserved the answer; this
  defines it. A message can now carry `{ kind: "artifact", name, mediaType, digest, size }` — the
  content address of the bytes, and nothing about where they live, so the store behind it can change
  without any message changing shape. This is the contract only: the transport that serves the bytes
  lands separately.

  The digest is the one field that is not taken on trust. `name`, `mediaType`, and `size` are
  whatever the sender wrote, and a receiver that sizes a buffer from `size` or dispatches on
  `mediaType` has believed a stranger; `verifyRawBytes` checks fetched bytes against the digest before
  they reach a caller, which is what catches a store handing back a truncated object — otherwise
  indistinguishable from a small one.

  `artifact` is a bare core kind rather than a namespaced extension, because reverse-DNS kinds are for
  wrapping vocabularies Cotal does not own, and this is Cotal's own reserved primitive. That
  distinction has teeth: a core kind the message validator does not know is not a schema detail. The
  validator gates the durable delivery frame, so an unrecognized core part means the backstop drops
  the whole message, silently, and the loss shows up nowhere near the part that caused it. The
  `artifact` guard is enforced there, and it checks the digest's form rather than only its type — a
  malformed digest is not a reference to anything, and admitting one would turn a bad message into a
  "missing artifact" that blames the store.

  Message rendering moves to a single `partsToText` in core. The same one-line expression had been
  copied into the connector inbox, `cotal join`, and the mesh view, and each copy fell back to
  stringifying a part's `data` field — which an artifact part does not have, so all three would have
  rendered it as the literal word "undefined". One renderer means a new core part kind is legible
  everywhere at once, or nowhere, never in two surfaces out of three.

- fd361fe: Serve the broker over TLS: the transport foundation, with the omission cases made unrepresentable.

  `serverConfig` and the new `openServerConfig` take a REQUIRED `transport` discriminated union
  (`plaintext` | `tls-required { certFile, keyFile }`) instead of an optional TLS field, and
  `standaloneConnectOpts` now requires an explicit `tls` boolean with no default. Both are breaking,
  and both are deliberate: an optional transport is omitted by default, and the omitted case is the
  dangerous one. A client with no TLS requirement still connects to a TLS broker — it upgrades the
  same socket after reading the server's unauthenticated `INFO` — so nothing looks wrong until an
  on-path attacker forges an `INFO` without `tls_required` and collects the credentials that a NATS
  client sends in its `CONNECT` line.

  Also in this change:

  - `cotal up`'s open (no-auth) mode now renders a config instead of launching from bare CLI flags, so
    no path reaches a listener without naming its transport. Previously a cert/key pair given to an
    open-mode `up` would have been accepted while the broker came up in cleartext.
  - `validateTlsMaterial` checks readability, private-key mode, pair match, validity window and
    dial-host SAN before the broker starts, because `nats-server` does not: it reports an expired
    certificate valid, starts, and serves it, and only the client fails.
  - `probeServedCert` / `assertServedCertMatches` complete a real STARTTLS upgrade and read back the
    leaf actually being served, so a rotation is proved rather than assumed. Renewing files on disk
    does not reload `nats-server`.
  - A durable broker launch policy records the transport so a TLS decision survives `cotal down`, and
    refuses rather than degrading when it cannot be honoured.
  - `MeshEntry.tlsRequired` carries TLS-required client intent (never cert paths) through to
    `Connection` and `endpointAuth`, so a CLI-resolved connection inherits the recorded decision.

  `allow_non_tls` is never emitted: it is mixed mode, and a client that declines the upgrade is served
  in cleartext. `handshake_first` and `verify`/`verify_and_map` are likewise never emitted — mTLS is a
  deliberate non-goal, since identity here is JWT/NKey plus the auth callout.

  ## What this guarantees, and what it does not

  **The guarantee.** `cotal up --tls-cert <cert> --tls-key <key>` either serves TLS or refuses to
  start. There is no third outcome. The transport is decided once, above every branch in `up`, so the
  manifest (`-f`), `--detach`, refresh and restore routes cannot reach a listener without naming it;
  each route re-checks the certificate against the host clients will actually dial. A running broker
  cannot change its transport, so passing the flags to an already-running mesh is refused rather than
  answered with a success line. The decision is recorded, so a later bare `cotal up` after a
  `cotal down` keeps serving TLS instead of silently reverting to cleartext.

  **A direct `CotalEndpoint` construction still defaults to plaintext.** `EndpointOptions.tls` remains
  optional and absent still means "no TLS required". If you build an endpoint yourself rather than
  going through `cotal up` or a resolved mesh record, you must pass `tls: true`; nothing will tell you
  otherwise, and the connection will succeed either way against a TLS broker because a NATS client
  upgrades the same socket once it reads the server's `INFO`. Making that field required is a tracked
  follow-up. It is called out here because "Cotal supports TLS" is not something you should be able to
  believe while your own client is connecting without requiring it.

  **Client-side strictness is NOT complete, and the honest scope is wider than a short list.** The
  broker refuses cleartext, so none of these connects in the clear against a healthy TLS broker — a
  NATS client upgrades the same socket once it reads `tls_required`. What they lack is their own
  requirement, which is the fence against a stripped or forged `INFO`, and that is the whole reason
  this feature exists.

  Two distinct cases, and the second is worse:

  _Never had a TLS path / passes `tls: false` explicitly._ `waitForDeliveryLease`
  (`packages/core/src/lease.ts`) builds its own `connect` options rather than going through
  `standaloneConnectOpts`. The user-auth service and the membership feed connect the same way.
  The **enumerated** `standaloneConnectOpts({ … tls: false })` sites at this tip (twelve, not a
  prose list) are:

  | File                                       | Lines              | Role                                                                                                                                                              |

  | `implementations/cli/src/commands/up.ts`   | 1155, 1234         | `provePreparedRestoreListener` / `proveOrdinaryResumeListener` authenticated JetStream proof (restore + ordinary-resume adopt only — not bare `up` / bare `down`) |
  | `implementations/cli/src/commands/down.ts` | 651, 691           | `assertControlPlaneQuiesced` / `readPresenceWithoutConsumer` — **only** on `down --preserve-state`, not bare `cotal down`                                         |

  Bare `cotal down` does **not** hit those two `down.ts` sites: it stops via pidfiles
  (`stopLocalProcess`) and never opens a broker wire. Live-checked twice: `up --detach --open
--tls-cert/--tls-key` then bare `down` (with `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` stripped on the down step) stops
  manager, delivery, and nats-server and leaves the port `ECONNREFUSED`. There is no silently-skipped
  safety gate on ordinary teardown.

  `down --preserve-state` is the only path that calls `assertControlPlaneQuiesced` (via
  `isReachable(mesh.server)` at `down.ts:585`, then the `tls: false` connects at :651/:691). Bare
  `isReachable(server)` is a plaintext INFO probe (`tcpInfoProbe`): on this branch's STARTTLS TLS it
  still returns **true** (INFO precedes the upgrade), so the quiescence gate is **entered**, not
  skipped, when the client trusts the CA. **Narrow residual (do not fix in this branch):**
  `down --preserve-state` **and** a CA the client does not trust — then a stricter `{tls:true}` probe
  would fail, the INFO probe still says up, and the subsequent authenticated connect without a trusted
  CA fails or the cut proceeds without a completed wire-truth lease proof depending on the failure
  mode. Same family as the private-CA diagnosis gap (S7); incomplete client fence, not an ordinary-path
  break. Flagless sites mostly **work** via auto-upgrade and are **unfenced** (no own requirement
  against a forged INFO), not "broken teardown."

  _Resolves the decision and then drops it (partially closed)._ `cotal web` now passes
  `tls: conn.tls` into its endpoint. `cotal status` carries `target.tlsRequired` on the Selected Mesh
  preflight, the open/auth live snapshot, the user-mode connection probe and user live snapshot, and
  the Recorded Meshes liveness check — a mesh recorded `tlsRequired: true` is not greened by a bare
  TCP/INFO probe against a plaintext substitute. What still drops the decision: the mesh manager
  (`startManagerDetached`'s options type has no `tls` field, so `ensureControlPlane` forwards `--tls`
  to the delivery daemon and then launches the manager without it), plus the never-had-a-path sites
  above.

  Client-side strictness landed for: `cotal up` (every route to a listener), the recorded mesh record
  (`MeshEntry.tlsRequired`), CLI-resolved connections that go through `resolveMeshTarget` /
  `endpointAuth`, `cotal status`, `cotal web`, and the delivery daemon's three dials. It has not
  landed for the manager process, the user-auth service, the membership feed, `waitForDeliveryLease`,
  or the twelve helper sites tabulated above. That table is the residual enumeration; do not collapse
  it back to prose.

  The delivery daemon is strict on all three of its dials, including the every-two-seconds reachability
  poll that re-presents its standing credential for the life of the process.

  **Also not included:** the `cotals://` handout from `up`; a rotation command; and `tls://` as a
  _server_ scheme enforcing anything (it is cosmetic at the client: nats.js connects plaintext to
  `tls://host` with empty options, and only the explicit `tls` option refuses). **Changing transport
  on a live broker is restart-only by construction:** passing `--tls-cert/--tls-key` (or dropping
  them) against an already-running mesh is refused — `cotal down`, then `cotal up` with the desired
  flags. A reload of `nats-server` is not offered, because it would leave established plaintext
  sessions alive.

  Operators using a private CA need `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, because `EndpointOptions.tls` is a boolean
  and cannot carry a CA file. The private-key permission check is POSIX-only.

  **S10 (fixed in this change):** a `tlsRequired` registry entry used to be **pruned** when a
  `connectOrExit` / `preflightOrExit` path ran without a trusted CA. `preflightTarget` probes with
  `{tls:true}`; certificate verification failure was classified as `unreachable` (prune:true), so
  `cotal send dm …` (and any other preflighted command) deleted a healthy mesh record on a recoverable
  trust error — durable state destroyed because the operator forgot `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Fix: when
  the recorded target requires TLS and the TLS probe fails as unreachable, confirm plaintext INFO
  still advertises `tls_required: true` (with a second, longer read before condemning); if it does,
  classify as `tls-trust` with **prune:false**. That proves a TLS-required NATS listener is present —
  INFO is unauthenticated and is not mesh identity — so the record is conservatively kept and the
  operator is told to fix the trust store (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`). A plaintext substitute on the same
  port does not advertise `tls_required` and still follows the normal unreachable/prune path.
  Live-checked both ways.

  **Named follow-ups (not fixed here):**

  - Defence-in-depth only: pass `mesh.tlsRequired ? {tls:true}:{}` at `down.ts:418`/`:585` and thread
    transport into `:651`/`:691` (measurement showed bare INFO already enters the preserve-state
    quiescence gate when the CA is trusted).
  - Bare `cotal down` pidfile-trust: hiding manager/delivery pidfiles while those processes still run
    lets bare down stop the broker and report success (pre-existing; filed separately).

- 019afc3: The manager control surface gains three capabilities on the v0.4 endpoint rails: spawn as an action, multi-manager instance addressing, and attach as a mesh session.

  Spawn and launch are now actions (SPEC 13.6). Asking the manager for an agent no longer blocks the caller while the process comes up: the manager accepts a spawn goal and returns the allocated identity at once (`{name, owner, actor, uid, goalId, fingerprint, executor{lifecycleUid, epoch}}`), then progress events follow the launch to a terminal outcome. Presence within the readiness window settles the goal `succeeded`, an early exit `failed`, and the window elapsing with neither is `uncertain` (a bounded, durable outcome a later `ps` settles against the live roster, never a silent hang). A persona-derived name collision auto-numbers; a hard-pinned `--name` colliding with a live agent refuses at accept, before anything is minted. The `--detach` CLI spawn, the manifest `-f` launch, and the connector's `cotal_spawn` submit and follow to the terminal, so their behavior is unchanged. The goal terminal is fenced to the executing manager's own gate epoch (the terminal lands on an epoch-scoped result subject), so a superseded incarnation's terminal is invisible to current readers; a durable reconcile index lets a restarted manager settle any goal a predecessor accepted but never terminalized. The goal-fact writer is a dedicated, family-staged, renewed credential disjoint from the serve credential.

  One space can now run more than one manager. Each manager persists a stable logical instance id across restarts and advances its process epoch when it comes back, so peers address a specific manager regardless of which process currently serves it; a restart re-registers the same instance and evicts its predecessor's serve family through a scoped, one-registration eviction credential. `cotal spawn --on <instance>` pins one instance by its exact id, an untargeted spawn rides class anycast (the acceptance records which instance took it), and `cotal ps` / `status` become a class scatter that merges every registered instance's rows with per-instance attribution and labels a non-answering instance unreachable, never omitting it. The manager lease is demoted from a per-space singleton to per-instance liveness (loss stops only that instance's serving, never the space), reconcile touches only rows the instance owns, and the retirement rail authorizes on the registration gate rather than a name-derived holder, so a deposed predecessor cannot retire a target.

  `cotal attach` no longer returns a `127.0.0.1` websocket URL. It creates a one-use, holder-bound session over the mesh: the reply carries a signed session grant (no URL, never logged), redeemed once, after which terminal bytes stream on session subjects scoped to the two parties, with backpressure surfaced as an explicit drop notice. A late attach still repaints the full screen from a replayed terminal snapshot, and close, expiry, target despawn, and manager restart are distinct, surfaced end states. The browser console is now a real mesh session client over a served bundle (the broker gains a localhost-default websocket listener), holding only a per-session, rails-only credential that expires with the session. The manager's session writer is a scoped, family-staged, renewed credential over a dedicated sessions store.

- f85ffbf: The manager now registers itself as an ordinary v0.4 `service` endpoint (`manager`) on every static auth mesh and dual-serves its FULL typed command surface on the endpoint rails beside the existing control tiers — nothing removed yet. The served commands mirror every control op through the same handler cores: `status`, `ps`, `inspect` (per-agent read), `models`, `spawn` (the full 16-field launch surface), targeted owner-mode `despawn`/`attach`, the baseline self-mode `stop`, `define-persona`, `purge`, `launch`, the resume/preservation family, and the reserved `describe`. `ps`/`inspect`/`spawn` replies now also carry each agent's `lifecycleUid` (the coordinate a targeted request pins). Core gains the production endpoint-serve credential subsystem over the durable auth store: the §13.1 endpoint issuance gate and serve ledger (`epgate…`/`epcred…`), the registration barrier with fail-closed eviction, and the serve-mint release fence — plus a key-pinned one-shot `endpoint-serve-executor` credential profile scoped to exactly one endpoint instance's gate, serve-ledger family, and registration record keys. The manager drives its registration and every serve-credential mint and renewal through that scoped executor connection (never its standing supervisor connection), applies one shared lifecycle-membership + maintenance admission gate on both control doors (the legacy `ctl` tiers and the new endpoint rails), and renews its bounded serve credential on the standing renewal pass. Registration also publishes the manager's §13.7 contract artifacts — every command's schema root, its closure manifest, and the cluster document — to the per-space content-addressed contract store (created create-or-verify at manager start alongside the authority stores), and every agent credential's baseline now carries the store's read grant, so any caller can fetch, verify, and recompile the registered schema digests without out-of-band contract sharing.

  The control CONSUMERS now ride those rails (static-auth meshes): every CLI manager call (`spawn --detach`, `ps`, `stop`, `attach`, `models`, `down`/`up`'s resume and preservation phases) and every connector supervision tool (`cotal_spawn`/`cotal_despawn`/`cotal_persona`, self-stop, history purge) goes through the generic invoke path - describe, fetch the registered schemas from the contract store, recompile digest-verified validators, invoke - instead of hand-importing the manager's contracts; invoke currency is describe-bound (the answering incarnation's broker-authenticated identity), so a superseded or split-brain manager refuses instead of answering stale. New `cotal describe <endpoint>` and `cotal invoke <endpoint> <command>` expose the same generic surface to operators. Operator reach is now minted, not door-refined: `control-caller-privileged`/`control-caller-admin`/`deployer` instrument credentials carry tier-matched endpoint capability rows (the admin tier's cross-agent `despawn`/`attach` ride the operator-only `any` authorization mode, declared in the manager's revision-3 cluster document), the spawn capability additionally mints `define-persona` + `inspect`, and an `admin`-capability credential mirrors the full admin instrument set. Open meshes and user-mode bearers kept the legacy `ctl` path until the final slice below.

  User-mode meshes join the migration end to end: the manager registers its v0.4 service on per-user meshes too (the registration/serve machinery is operator infrastructure riding the space's static trust material), the CLI's bearer path derives its caller triple from the bearer's ledger lifecycle claim, the connector's endpoint identity is its triple in every auth mode (no ctl branch left in the connector), and `spawn -f`'s deploy probe drives `ps`/`launch` over the generic invoke path for both the static admin credential and the user-mode deployer view. Serve-side hardening: every `manager.admin`-class command (purge, launch, and the resume/preservation family) re-checks operator reach at serve time against the caller's CURRENT ledger scope on user meshes, so a revoked `admin` scope demotes the next call instead of riding out the bearer's remaining row lifetime.

  The migration is now complete: the manager's legacy `ctl` control rail is deleted. Core drops the `manager`/`self`/`admin` control tiers, the `ControlTier` type, and `controlSubject`; the server-side `ctl.delivery`/`ctl.delivery-admin`/`ctl.auth-admin` rails (the delivery daemon's and auth service's own carve-outs) are unchanged. Every credential profile is endpoint-only: agent baselines lose the `ctl.self` publish and control-reply subscribe rows, the supervisor serves no control tier, and the operator instruments carry endpoint capability rows only, so the old manager control subjects are unreachable end to end (publish rows, serve subscriptions, and handlers are all gone). The manager registers its `service` endpoint on EVERY mesh: auth meshes ride the scoped endpoint-serve executor; open meshes run the same gate/registration/serve-grant ceremony over bare one-shot connections (no credential is ever minted; the broker enforces nothing on an open mesh) and create-or-verify the authority stores at boot, so a raw broker no longer dies at the first gate write. The CLI's control layer replaces `ControlTier` with `ControlReach` (`owner`/`any`): the target's authorization mode derives from the resolved target owner (an own-domain target rides owner mode; a cross-owner target rides any mode, which the broker admits only for admin-instrument holders), open meshes ride a bare caller triple, and a raw `--creds` control caller without an endpoint caller identity refuses loud instead of falling back. `ps`/`inspect` rows pin `role` as optional (a manifest-launched agent declares none, and the reply schema previously failed the responder's own output).

- 11cd652: `cotal ps` on a user-auth mesh no longer class-scatters.

  **Why.** The class scatter freezes the live manager set via a records-bucket `STREAM.INFO` read that only the static `control-caller-privileged` instrument holds. A user-mode bearer never has that row, so scatter died on a permissions violation that read as "no manager" — even when a manager was up and would have answered `ep.one.manager.ps`. Measured: an admin-scoped user bearer is served on `ep.one`; the same bearer is refused on the freeze.

  **What changes.** Mode is chosen up front from the connection shape, never try-scatter-catch-degrade:

  - **User-auth:** `ep.one` to one manager (in-memory roster, owner-filtered). Multi-manager completeness is not claimed; an unreachable manager fails the command rather than printing a bare empty list.
  - **Static / open:** class scatter unchanged (freeze + per-instance attribution, unreachable labeled).

  `connectOrExit` now refuses a `control-caller-*` instrument request on a user-mode mesh (those profiles are static-only); `resolveControlTarget` translates to the user bearer path explicitly. `deployer` is unchanged (real `userViewAuth` elevation). Docs state the user-mode completeness bound. Gated: `smoke:ps-operator-path` (static + dead-manager honesty) and `smoke:ps-user-mode` (user path + dead-manager non-zero).

  **Known limitation.** This fix's correctness relies on the ep tier boundary asserted at `user-spawn.smoke.ts` B1e (a spawn-scope bearer's `ps` is broker-dropped). That suite is **not** in the `smoke:ci` chain, so the invariant is unprotected by CI. Gating it is out of scope here and is tracked separately.

- 185e721: Renew the `$SYS` credentials without tearing the space down.

  `membership-observer.creds` and `connection-evictor.creds` carry a 30-day expiry and are signed by
  the system-account seed, which is never persisted, so nothing re-signs them in place. The only
  repair the tooling named was "`cotal down` then a fresh `cotal up`", and that did nothing: `up`
  mints the pair only on the branch that _creates_ the trust record, so re-upping a provisioned space
  reused the same expired files and reported success. A long-running mesh therefore lost its
  membership feed and live connection eviction every 30 days with no supported way back.

  `cotal up --rotate-sys` is that way back. It issues a new system account under the same broker
  operator, mints both `$SYS` creds against it, and renders the broker config from the rotated record,
  so the broker it starts is the one that trusts them. The data account, the account signing key,
  every agent credential minted from it and the JetStream store are untouched; what dies is the
  retired system account, on every broker that loads the rotated config. It is refused wherever the
  on-disk material and the broker could end up on different generations: a running mesh; an open mesh,
  whether that comes from `--open` or from `broker.auth: false` in a manifest; `--restore`; an
  unfinished restore or resume attempt on the root, including one a bare `cotal up` would recover,
  since those paths can adopt a live listener and return without booting a broker; and a root hosting
  more than one space, because the system account lives in the shared broker record and the rotation is
  therefore broker-wide. `rotateSystemCreds` is exported from `@cotal-ai/workspace` and carries the
  multi-tenant guard itself rather than at the CLI flag. It is deliberately a workstation operation and
  takes no `SecretStore`: the `$SYS` pair has no store seam to be written through, and because a
  `SecretStore` cannot be enumerated, accepting one would mean a broker-wide guard that reads a local
  filesystem while enforcing nothing for the tenants actually at risk.

  A rotation requires every broker for the root to be stopped, and three checks now say so: this root's
  recorded mesh at the requested address, anything unidentified answering there (which refuses instead
  of relocating to a free port), and the root's own ownership records: a live or unreadable `nats.pid`,
  or any recorded mesh for this root still reachable. Without them a lost registry row, or a
  `nats-server` started by hand against this root's `server.conf`, was enough to bypass the running-mesh
  refusal: `up` found the port busy, picked a free one, rotated, and left the old broker serving the
  retired config while a second one ran against the same JetStream store. These are Cotal's ownership
  records rather than a scan of the process table, and the docs say so: a hand-started broker on a
  different port writes none of them and is the named residual.

  Two consequences the tooling now states rather than leaving to be discovered. The retirement is
  config-load-bound, so a stale broker still running the previous config keeps honouring the old creds
  until it is stopped. And a full backup binds to the trust chain it was taken against, which includes
  the operator JWT and the system account, so every full artifact taken before a rotation refuses to
  restore afterwards: the rotation says so as it happens, and `cotal up --restore` names the drift when
  the data account still matches. The commit is a trust-record write plus two credential writes, so an
  interrupted rotation leaves the record ahead of the creds; that split is detected rather than
  silent. One shared check compares each `$SYS` cred's issuer against the persisted record, and it
  runs on every auth-mesh boot as well as in `cotal doctor auth`, so the state cannot pass unremarked
  by a mesh that simply never runs the doctor. The boot REFUSES rather than warning: a warning becomes an unread log line
  under `--detach`'s success output, and live connection eviction rides the same credential pair, so
  booting would silently downgrade revocation to deny-new for the life of the mesh. The delivery daemon, which never
  loads the signer and so cannot read the record, compares the two creds against each other instead.

  The recovery is covered end-to-end as well as in unit form: a suite drives the packaged binary
  against a real broker, a real delivery daemon and a real manager, on a root whose `$SYS` pair is
  already past its horizon. It asserts the reported symptom (the daemon's membership feed does not
  start, and says which credential and which repair), that `down` + a plain `up` leaves both files
  byte-identical and the doctor red, and that `down` + `up --rotate-sys` clears it in the daemon that
  reported it. The survival claim is checked rather than asserted: an agent credential minted before
  the rotation still connects afterwards, the CHAT stream returns at the same sequence and count, and
  registry state written before the rotation reads back through the CLI after it.

  Diagnosis now names the cause instead of the symptom. An expired observer cred used to surface as a
  bare "Authorization Violation" in the delivery log and, one layer up, as a `membership-rw` adoption
  refused with "membership feed is not running", neither of which mentions a credential. The daemon
  checks the observer's own expiry before connecting and reports it, carries that reason into the
  adoption reply, and the manager warns on every renewal pass from the 75% point onward rather than
  letting the mesh discover the expiry at the horizon. `cotal doctor auth`, `evictPrincipal`,
  `planeConnLiveness` and the two mint errors now print the repair that works. Where the feed is down
  because its bundle is incomplete rather than expired, the daemon now names the missing files and
  distinguishes the two cases: a missing `$SYS` observer is re-minted by a rotation, while a space
  predating broker-sourced membership is missing the rw cred and the account id as well, which a
  rotation does not write, so it is told the truth rather than sent through a stop/start that cannot
  help it.

### Patch Changes

- 91b75e3: Stop the control-target mode peek from exiting on an off-registry target. `--server` with an unregistered `--space` is the raw-open escape hatch and has no registry entry to carry a mode, but the peek resolved through the exiting form and ended the command before `connectOrExit` could serve it.
- d49f505: Sandbox `server-resolution:live`'s fixtures so a stray `.cotal` above the temp base cannot capture them.

  `findCotalRoot` walks to `/` with no boundary, so one `.cotal` anywhere above the temp base captures
  every fixture a suite mints there. This suite is unusually exposed: the whole premise of its `cwd`
  fixture is that it has NO `.cotal` up-tree, so bare resolution falls through to the registry. Under a
  captured base that premise is simply false.

  Measured, both arms, against a deliberately poisoned base: unconverted, the suite resolved against a
  foreign registry and dialled the shared local demo broker instead of its own fixture. Converted, it
  rejects the captured base, mints under a clean one, and passes its 18 checks. The scratch is
  witnessed with `assertScratchHeld` rather than assumed, which is the half that makes it evidence.

  Only this one entry is converted. The other live entries mint raw too, but minting raw is not the
  same as being captured: tested by artifact, two of four write into a captured root and two never
  touch it. A sweep would have "fixed" suites that were never broken, so the rest want the
  poisoned-base arm run per suite first (tracked on #360).

- 14ff831: Stop reading another user's live process as dead.

  Asking the kernel about a process has three answers, not two: it is there, it is gone, or it is
  there but not ours to signal (`EPERM`). A two-state probe folds the third into "gone", and the
  caller then acts on a running process as if it had died.

  The repo already had a tri-state contract that gets this right, documenting itself as "consumed
  everywhere". Two production files imported it. Sixteen other production call sites probed inline,
  and **seven of the fourteen files handled `EPERM` correctly on their own while seven did not**, so
  this was a coin flip repeated fourteen times rather than one broken helper.

  Fixed, with the wrong answer named at each site:

  | site                       | what the old probe did                                                                        |
  | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `manager-proc.managerUp`   | reported no manager, so `ensureManager` starts a second one onto a live one                   |
  | `delivery-proc.deliveryUp` | same, for the delivery daemon: two daemons on one fanout                                      |
  | `auth` `agent-bearer`      | "the user-auth service is not running, restart it with `cotal up`" about a service that is up |
  | `auth` provider            | same misread on the readiness path                                                            |
  | `cli ext`                  | printed "stale pidfile" about a live extension, which is advice to delete it                  |

  Both `up` functions also parsed their pidfile with `Number.isFinite`, which admits fractional and
  out-of-range values `process.kill` throws on. They now use the contract's bounded parser.

  The contract moved from `implementations/cli/src/lib/pid.ts` to `@cotal-ai/workspace`, the widest
  tier that may hold a local-process concept. **"Consumed everywhere" was never reachable and the
  claim hid the gap:** `extensions/*` peer-depend `core` only, and a pid probe is not a wire concept,
  so reaching them would mean leaking a local concern into the standard. The two extension-side
  probes keep their own copies by construction, and the module now says so instead of overclaiming.

  Presence questions require PROOF (`=== "alive"`); only destructive questions preserve on doubt
  (`!== "dead"`, which is why `down.ts` is written that way and is untouched). An earlier revision of
  this change had the presence sites preserving too, and review reproduced what that buys: a permanent,
  silent, retry-proof false-up, where the control plane reports `running: true` three times over
  against an unreachable manager. The demonstrated defect was `EPERM` alone, and widening past it was
  unforced.

  Covered by a new broker-free suite, `smoke:pid-contract`. The errno-to-state mapping is a pure
  exported function tested exhaustively, so there is no fixture to skip: the first revision reached the
  `EPERM` rule only by probing pid 1 and hoping the process was unprivileged, and as root or in a
  container that cell skipped while the suite still printed a passing banner over a deliberately broken
  implementation. The suite also drives the CONVERTED CALLERS through real pidfiles, because the first
  revision tested only the primitive and a reviewer inverted all five call sites without reddening a
  single check.

  `unknown` is REACHABLE on a real kernel, not merely under a test shim. A Linux seccomp
  `SECCOMP_RET_ERRNO` filter, or an LSM policy through `security_task_kill()`, can answer
  `kill(pid, 0)` with an arbitrary errno without executing it, and libuv preserves it. Review proved
  this with a live seccomp BPF filter and no interposition. So both ways of folding the third state
  into a boolean are wrong, and both fail SILENTLY: preserving reports a control plane that is not
  there and no retry clears it, while requiring proof launches a second manager over one that may be
  live.

  `ensureManager` and `ensureDelivery` therefore REFUSE on `unknown`, loudly, naming the pid, naming
  seccomp/LSM as the expected cause inside sandboxes, and saying what to check. `managerLiveness` and
  `deliveryLiveness` expose the state the booleans cannot carry; `managerUp`/`deliveryUp` remain
  `=== "alive"` for display, with a doc note sending any caller that ACTS on the answer to the
  tri-state.

  Honest coverage limit, stated in the suite's own output rather than implied away: no cell here
  exercises `unknown`, because no `parsePid`-accepted input produces one from this process. The refusal
  is verified by a seccomp BPF harness outside the suite.

- a74a768: Sandbox the temp root in the smokes that mint a mesh fixture there, so a `.cotal` left above the temp base (`/tmp/.cotal` on Linux CI runners) can no longer capture the fixture and make a suite grade a live mesh. One shared implementation in `bin/smoke/_scratch.ts`, used by `spawn-from-anywhere`, `down-target`, and both `ps` suites. The dead-manager cells now assert that the manager was found, was alive, and is dead, instead of skipping their own kill when the pid file is missing.

### Minor Changes

- 531d37d: Register, list and unregister meshes from the CLI.

  `cotal meshes add <space> --server <url> [--root <dir>] [--mode auth|open]` records a mesh this
  machine did not start — one running on another machine, a shared broker, a hosted space — so
  `--space`, `cotal use` and a bare `cotal spawn` can reach it from any directory. The broker is
  probed before anything is written, so a wrong address or credentials that mesh will not accept fail
  at registration instead of at the first spawn; `--force` records without verifying and replaces an existing
  record. `cotal meshes rm <space> …` drops records (never stopping a mesh: a mesh running here is
  refused in favour of `cotal down`) and releases the `current` pointer when it pointed at one.

  Registry records now carry an origin, and an automatic prune only ever deletes records that
  `cotal up` wrote. A record added by hand cannot be reconstructed by this machine, so an unreachable
  broker under one is reported — `offline` in `cotal meshes`, and a preflight failure that names
  `cotal meshes rm` rather than `cotal up` — instead of silently unregistering a mesh that was live
  all along.

- 498055c: Stop paying one network round trip per record, and return the recent messages history claimed to return.

  Several read paths issued one sequential round trip per record, which is invisible against a loopback
  broker and ruinous on any ordinary cross-continent link. Measured against a mesh at 534ms RTT with
  healthy uplinks at both ends, reading the membership feed took 30 to 34 seconds for 89 entries; it
  now takes under a second for 93.

  - `liveKvEntries` is the one sanctioned full-bucket KV read: a single pass whose request count is
    independent of record count, which collapses by greatest revision with tombstones so a deleted key
    cannot resurrect, and which binds its own consumer so that an empty result is PROVEN by the
    bind-time pending count rather than inferred from silence. A pass that is cut short raises rather
    than returning what arrived. That distinction is load-bearing on the ACL path: read this way, a
    dropped link mid-scan would otherwise report a provisioned principal as having no ACL row, and a
    durable join would be refused as "not provisioned" instead of as "could not read". The membership
    feed, the members and channel registries, and the ACL alias enumeration all read through it. No
    change to broker authority: the same ordered push consumer over the same subject.
  - `channelHistory` and `dmHistory` returned the OLDEST messages on any channel holding more than the
    requested limit, while being documented as recent and rendered everywhere as the latest. They now
    return the newest, read through a bounded window rather than by draining the backlog.
  - `cotal status` started the Claude CLI twice for data one listing contains.

  Two optimisations were attempted and REVERTED during review, and are not part of this change: the
  dashboard's activity feed still fetches a full page per channel (the cheaper version dropped
  genuinely-newer messages, because saturation counts messages rather than recency), and control
  commands still open a probe connection before the real one (skipping it flattened typed auth
  failures and lost the probe's deadline).

  This is the read-path half of the work. The registry-safety half — a failed network probe must not
  delete a mesh record — is a separate change on top of the `origin`/`pruneMesh` model from
  `cotal meshes add`.

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- f89560a: New Codex connector (`--agent codex`): an OpenAI Codex session as a full lateral mesh peer, in Codex's own TUI. A host-mode peer drives a `codex app-server` thread over JSON-RPC: inbound batches wake a real turn, and directed messages steer INTO a live turn mid-flight.

  `cotal spawn --agent codex` opens Codex's own TUI. The app-server runs as a loopback websocket listener guarded by a per-incarnation capability token (0600, inside the agent's private home), and the TUI attaches to the very thread the mesh drives, so mesh turns render as they happen and anything you type is a real user turn on that same thread. With no terminal (piped output, CI, a smoke) the host stays headless with an activity feed instead; `COTAL_CODEX_TUI=1|0` picks the mode explicitly when the tty check would guess wrong. Once Codex owns the terminal the host's own log moves to `host.log` in the agent's private home, and the handoff line names that path so a later failure is findable.

  The shared `cotal_*` tools are served by the host process itself over a bearer-authenticated loopback MCP endpoint, with the token passed to codex by env var name so it never reaches the process table. Because the app-server is the MCP client, the same tools work on a mesh-driven turn and on one typed into the TUI; the connector's own tools are pre-approved so an unattended agent never stalls on an approval prompt nobody is watching, and `mcp_servers.cotal.*` is reserved and refused rather than silently overridden.

  Autonomy defaults suit an agent woken by peer messages when nobody is watching: `approval_policy=never` (never ask before running a command, not refuse), `sandbox_mode=workspace-write`, and `sandbox_workspace_write={network_access=true}`. Network is on because Codex's own workspace-write default has it off, which breaks installing a dependency or pushing a branch with an error that reads like the task is impossible rather than the sandbox refusing; filesystem containment is kept, because a peer's message is a remote input that can make the agent run commands. The network default is applied only where the sandbox is actually `workspace-write`, so tightening the mode does not leave a network grant in the launch. All three are overridable per spawn with `--opt` (including `sandbox_mode=danger-full-access` for no sandbox at all), while an interactive `approval_policy` is refused loud rather than auto-answered on the operator's behalf.

  The guide states the sandbox's guarantee literally: it blocks out-of-workspace local filesystem writes, and does not block reads, exfiltration, or networked side effects. With the network on, a peer-driven turn can read broadly and send what it reads, reach loopback and link-local services, and act through any credential it can read, including irreversibly, via a force-push or an API delete. Containing filesystem writes is not the same as containing damage, and the docs say so rather than implying the residual is disclosure-only. The offline, tighter-mode, and separate-OS-user mitigations are named in both the autonomy section and Limits.

  At-least-once delivery with exact-id acks on turn completion: a failed turn retries with backoff, an interrupt redelivers, and an app-server crash restarts the child in place on the same mesh lifecycle and re-drives the un-acked batch (a crash loop is fatal, never an endless respawn). Presence from the event stream, an opt-in transcript mirror, model catalog + reasoning-effort variants (`cotal models --agent codex`, `--variant`), `--opt` passthrough to codex `-c` config overrides, and a private per-agent `CODEX_HOME` (operator config/hooks/MCP servers never load; auth.json symlinked; trust writes never touch the operator's config). Unwired options fail loud: `--resume` (a resumed codex thread comes up without its configured MCP servers, so the agent would be mute on the mesh) and tool-sharing.

  Also fixes the seed reconciler, which treated a generation match alone as up-to-date: a built-in connector added at an unchanged generation would never seed on an already-installed workstation (`--agent codex` reporting no connector installed). Both fast paths now also require every `SEED_BUILTINS` entry to be present in the ever-seeded set.

  A connector can now declare `launchHint`, the one line a foreground `cotal spawn` prints about what to expect next. That text used to be hard-coded to Claude Code's first-run gate for every agent type, telling operators of other harnesses to press Enter at a prompt that never appears.

  The web dashboard gains Codex branding (the OpenAI mark, from Simple Icons), so a codex agent renders with an icon and a label instead of a blank badge. That map was hand-maintained with nothing tying it to the connector set, so it is now covered by a test: every official connector must have a complete entry, and a new connector cannot ship icon-less with a green suite again.

## 0.14.11

### Patch Changes

- ca962f7: Fix `cotal setup` failing on every upgrade with `plugin <name>@cotal-mesh is at version <old>,
expected <new> (the update did not take)`. `installOrUpdatePlugin` ran `claude plugin update`
  only inside the install-failed branch, but `claude plugin install` reports "is already
  installed" and exits **zero**, so on an upgrade the update never fired, the Claude plugin cache
  kept the old version, and the verification step then threw. The update is now triggered by what
  `plugin install` reports rather than by an exit status that never comes, which is what closes
  the upgrade path for the `cotal` connector plugin and the `cotal-skills` plugin alike.

  Also correct setup's own Node preflight, which still checked for Node 20 and told the user
  "Cotal needs Node 20 or newer" while `cotal-ai` declares and enforces a Node 22 floor.

## 0.14.9

### Patch Changes

- a4c082a: `cotal down web` now works from any directory. The dashboard starts target-resolved (registry current mesh first) and records its pidfile under the target mesh's root, but a selective `down` only looked under the folder it ran in and reported "Nothing running for web" while the dashboard kept running. A `LocalProcess` can now declare `rootedAt: "target"`; `down` resolves such components through the same mesh-target resolution the start side uses, with a new `cotal down web --space <name>` to name the mesh explicitly. Bare `cotal down` remains a folder-scoped sweep, and folder-rooted components refuse `--space`.
- c88ef4c: `cotal spawn -f` now deploys to a remote manager: when the mesh's serving manager lives in another checkout or on another host, the resolved launch spec rides the `launch` control op inline — the manager validates it with the same untrusted-input contract as the file path and persists it under its own `.cotal/run/` (stale-restart and retained resume read one source either way). The ledger stays with the deploying checkout, so `down -f` works from there too. Also fixes a pre-existing re-apply edge: the transient persona file is now written atomic-replace instead of exclusive-create, so re-launching an agent after a partial deploy failure no longer dies on EEXIST.

Submitted on first boot and on stale-restart (hash-covered, so changing it marks a running agent stale); a reclaim of a still-live session does not re-submit. Imperative `--prompt` alongside a manifest launch is still rejected (one source). `topology view` marks agents that carry one.

## 0.14.7

### Patch Changes

- 12ad5e3: Close two attach defects: a capability issued for the wrong agent, and remote attach silently dying after a manager repair.

  **An attach capability could be issued for an incarnation nobody authorized.** `opAttach` resolved the
  agent name, awaited authorization — which on a user mesh performs a ledger read, a real async
  boundary — and then asked for a ticket by NAME. Ticket issuance re-resolved that name and bound
  whichever agent held the slot at that moment. A stop and same-name respawn landing inside the await
  therefore authorized one incarnation and handed out a valid terminal capability for its successor,
  which on a user-auth mesh can belong to a different owner. `url()` now requires the authorized handle
  and refuses when the slot has moved under it, and `opAttach` re-asserts the incarnation immediately
  after the await so the non-pty path shares the invariant. This is the same class as the name-binding
  fix in 0.14.4, one step earlier in the sequence: that closed the window at redemption, this closes it
  at issuance.

  **A manager replacement quietly demoted attach to loopback.** The bind host for the manager's
  attach/console face was passed only on the first `cotal up` and never recorded, so every later launch
  for the same mesh fell back to loopback: a same-root repair, adopting a preserved or restored
  listener, and a `spawn -f` manifest deploy. The broker, the agents, and the mesh all stayed up, so the
  only symptom was `cotal attach` failing to connect from another machine. It is not derivable after
  the fact — a broker dial address is deliberately not treated as a manager bind address — so the
  decision is now recorded on the mesh entry and read back by every manager launch. An explicit
  `--host` still wins, and a mesh that never asked for exposure records nothing and stays loopback-only.

  Also narrows `.cotal/manager.log` to 0600 (new and existing), since the manager's console URL is
  written there and that URL carries a credential reaching every agent's terminal.

### Patch Changes

- eccf48c: Make `cotal attach` reach a manager on another machine, and credential that endpoint properly.

  The manager's attach face bound a hardcoded `127.0.0.1` and advertised that same literal in the URL
  it handed back over the control plane, so a remote operator dialed their own loopback and got
  `ECONNREFUSED`. Attach only ever worked when the manager happened to be on the same box.

  **Where it binds is now an explicit decision.** The endpoint takes a bind address, still loopback by
  default, so a bare `cotal supervise` and an embedded `Manager` keep exactly the machine-local
  endpoint they have always had. `cotal up` passes the address it bound the broker to (via a new
  `supervise --console-host`), which is what makes a remote attach work. The broker's _dial_ address is
  deliberately not reused as the _bind_ address: a manager may supervise a broker on another host and
  cannot bind that address at all, and a failover list's first entry need not be the server actually
  selected. Where the manager can only name loopback — a wildcard bind — the client substitutes the
  broker address its own control connection reached, so `up --host 0.0.0.0` works too instead of
  silently handing back an unreachable URL.

  **The endpoint is now credentialed, in two tiers.** It carries terminal read and write for every
  managed agent, plus the managed roster and the live mesh feed, so once it can leave the machine
  "unauthenticated but loopback-only" stops being a safe position. A mesh caller receives a **ticket**
  bound to the one agent the manager just authorized, single-use and short-lived; this is what makes
  the existing per-agent owner/admin check real, since a manager-wide token would let a caller
  legitimately authorized for its own agent swap the path and take over another owner's terminal. The
  **console token** is the operator's own, reaches every agent because the console drives all of them,
  and is printed solely to the manager's own output. The roster, feed, and PTY stream answer `401`
  without a credential; the static console shell stays open, since it describes no agent.

  Credentials never ride a cookie: cookies are host-scoped rather than port-scoped, so one set here
  would be sent to every other HTTP service on the same host and would collide between two managers on
  one box. The console URL carries its token in the fragment, which a browser never sends to a server,
  and the console page is served `no-store` with `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.

  Also fixes an IPv6 regression in the same area: `URL.hostname` returns an IPv6 literal bracketed
  (`[::1]`), which `listen()` treats as a DNS name and fails `ENOTFOUND`. Brackets are stripped for the
  bind and restored for the advertised URL. An address this host does not own now fails with the
  address named and the resolutions spelled out, rather than a bare errno from deep inside startup.

  Covered by a new `smoke:attach-auth` in the CI gate (38 checks), including the cross-agent path-swap
  that the first design allowed.

### Patch Changes

- fce3199: Report which machine an agent runs on, and fix three defects that only appear once a mesh spans hosts.

  **`meta.host` on the agent card.** A mesh can span machines: a manager on another box launches
  agents into its own host, so "where is this agent actually running" was unanswerable from the
  roster. Each session now publishes its own `os.hostname()` as `meta.host`, overlaid last like
  `meta.connector` so an agent file cannot claim a host it is not on. It is advisory display
  metadata only, never an authorization or routing input, and the dashboard renders it with no
  change (unknown meta keys already display generically). `SPEC.md` records it alongside the other
  reserved `meta` keys.

  **`cotal up --host <addr>` killed the broker it had just started.** The bind address and the
  broker URL were tracked independently, so `--host` bound one address while the readiness probe
  still used the loopback default. The probe found nothing, timed out, and the caller SIGTERM'd a
  broker that had started correctly, which made `--host` alone impossible to use. The two are now
  reconciled: with no explicit `--server`, the URL is derived from the host; a contradicting pair is
  refused with one sentence instead of starting something unreachable; and wildcard binds
  (`0.0.0.0`, `::`) correctly keep a dialable loopback URL rather than advertising the wildcard. The
  manifest path (`broker.host` without `broker.servers`) had the same defect and shares the fix.

  **One slow probe silently unregistered a live mesh.** `pruneStaleMeshes` deleted any registry
  entry that failed a single reachability check whose budget is 1s, which a healthy broker across a
  slow or jittery link misses routinely. Deletion is destructive and, for a mesh this machine did
  not start, unrecoverable, since only `cotal up` writes registry records. A first failure now only
  makes an entry a candidate; it is pruned only if a second, longer probe also fails. A genuinely
  dead mesh still prunes.

  **A timed-out request killed the whole dashboard.** `cotal web` passed an async listener to
  `createServer`, so a rejection inside any route (for example a JetStream call timing out against a
  slow broker) became an unhandled rejection and took the process down on the first slow request.
  The dashboard is a read-only observer: a failing route now returns 500 and the server stays up.

### Patch Changes

- 5457b55: Require Node >= 22 and fail fast with a clear message on older Node.

  The bundled `nats-server` broker (`@eplightning/nats-server-*`) declares `engines.node >= 22`, and
  npm silently skips an optional dependency whose engine the running Node doesn't satisfy — so on any
  Node older than 22 the broker binary was never installed, surfacing later as a misleading
  "nats-server not found". Older Node also crashed the CLI outright on a Node-20+ regex in a transitive
  dependency, and only a non-fatal engine warning was emitted rather than a hard stop.

  The executable entry is now a thin Node-version preflight (`bin/cotal.ts`) that checks the running
  Node before any heavy import is parsed and hands off to the real composition root (`bin/run.ts`) only
  when it passes; on Node < 22 it prints an actionable message (upgrade Node; clear the npx cache if a
  stale install is being reused) and exits non-zero. The declared `engines.node` floor is corrected from
  `>=20` to `>=22` to match the broker's real requirement (Node 20/21 satisfied the old floor but
  never got the bundled broker), and the `nats-server` resolution error now names the root cause and
  the fix instead of a generic PATH hint.

### Patch Changes

- cf6b82f: fix(cli): re-offer the global install on a repeat `npx cotal-ai setup`

  `offerGlobalInstall` only ran on the first-run path (`runFirstRun`). The onboarded marker
  (`~/.cotal/onboarded.json`) is written once, so every later `cotal setup` routed to `runEnsure`,
  which never offered the install. Any machine that had already onboarded — declined or failed the
  install the first time, or onboarded before the offer existed — could re-run `npx cotal-ai setup`
  forever and never get a durable `cotal` on PATH. `runEnsure` now runs the same offer, gated by the
  same `isNpx()` + PATH scan, so it's a no-op for a dev clone or an already-installed `cotal` and only
  fires for the npx-without-`cotal` case it's meant to fix.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a46ce5: W4 multi-space-per-broker: split broker trust from per-space accounts and harden the broker-vs-space boundary.

  Broker trust (`operator` + system account) is now persisted once per broker in `auth/broker.json`, and each space keeps only its own data account in a flat, injective, case-safe `auth/account.<key>.json` beside it (`<key>` is hex of the space name, so two case-differing spaces can never collide on a case-insensitive filesystem). Core splits the provisioning surface to match: `createBrokerAuth` mints broker trust, `createSpaceAccountAuth(broker, space)` signs one tenant's account under it, and `serverConfig(broker, spaces, opts)` (breaking signature change) renders one operator with N space accounts.

  That same injective hex key now keys EVERY tenant-keyed namespace, not just the account file: the per-space user-auth state dir (`auth/space.<key>/`, with a one-time byte-exact rename of pre-hex layouts on first touch), the auth secret-store keys built over it (callout/issuer/owner-secret/service-keys), the machine mesh registry (`~/.cotal/meshes/space.<key>.json`, with legacy records swept on write/remove), and the auth-service pid/log files. Previously each of those case-folded, so `alpha` and `Alpha` could silently share state, registry records, and owner secrets. The hex key is injective only over well-formed strings, so the one builder now rejects a space name carrying an unpaired surrogate (which UTF-8 folds to U+FFFD, collapsing distinct names) before any key is derived. The auth-service pid/log files also carry a pre-hex-name upgrade path: `down`/`status` admit the old `auth-service.<encoded>.pid` byte-exact so an upgrade across the re-key never orphans the running user-auth callout signer, failing loud if both the old and new name are present.

  Broker-wide lifecycle operations (`down`, `clean store|all`, `backup`, `up --restore`, and the `clean restore-attempt|restore-fallback` recovery verbs) refuse on a root that hosts more than one space, naming the tenants they would have taken out, since none can be scoped to a single space. The tenant list is one validated inventory shared by the guards, `cotal status`, and the target resolver: each record's authoritative `space` must round-trip against its filename, and anything else occupying the account namespace (unparseable, mismatched, or a non-regular entry such as a symlink) counts as corrupt and makes the guards refuse rather than undercount.

  The broker record write is now two-sided fail-closed. `saveBrokerAuth` still refuses a different operator over an existing record; a same-operator system-account change is guarded by a persisted GENERATION with successor semantics: `rotateSystemAccount` bumps `BrokerAuth.gen` in memory and the write is accepted only as the direct successor of the current record, so a stale pre-rotation copy can never resurrect a retired `$SYS` (including one minted within the same second, where the JWT issue time cannot order the two; equal-generation writes with a different system account are refused, and only a byte-identical re-save is the idempotent no-op). The generation is runtime-validated on both sides and at the rotate step: only true absence reads as 0 (migration), while any present malformed value, explicit null included, refuses as a corrupt record. And with `broker.json` absent it refuses any operator that did not verifiably sign every existing account record (so a lost broker file cannot be "repaired" into orphaning the tenants; a same-operator restore still passes).

  The user-auth on-disk marker no longer keys on the bare existence of a path (which a space named `broker.json` or `creds` could alias into user-mode); it requires the provider's pin inside a real state directory, and the pin check is errno-disciplined: only ENOENT reads as absent, while EACCES and friends throw instead of silently flipping a user-auth space to static mode. The pre-hex state-dir migration refuses, rather than guesses, the one genuinely ambiguous case (a space literally named `space.<hex>`, whose legacy directory name is also another space's canonical segment).

  `cotal status` never crashes on trust material it cannot read: it reports the tenant list including corrupt records on a multi-space root, and frames any account record that will not load or compose (a malformed account JWT, or one signed by a foreign operator) as an unloadable record with repair guidance, exiting 0. Target resolution fails loud with a typed error rather than silently picking one tenant or crashing: an ambiguous-target on a multi-account root, on `--server` when the named broker's root holds several tenants on disk (one registered or not), and whenever the tenant list is unreadable; an unreadable-auth when a record cannot be composed into usable trust. The tenant inventory validates each record's account shape (so a semantically empty record is corrupt, not a phantom tenant), while the broker-binding check that a record cannot be validated without a broker stays at the consumer, keeping the broker.json-missing repair path from over-classifying every account as corrupt.

### Patch Changes

- ffbb43f: fix(cli): accept npm's array-form version output in `cotal update`

  `cotal update`'s "is a newer binary available" check parsed `npm view cotal-ai@latest version --json` as a bare JSON string. Real npm only returns a bare string while the registry holds a single published version; once more than one version exists it wraps the field in a JSON array (`["0.13.2"]`) even for the `@latest` tag. The strict string check then failed with `npm returned an invalid cotal-ai version`, so the whole command errored at the final step on every real install. The parser now accepts both the string and array forms and takes the highest valid semver, and still rejects empty/garbage output loudly.

- 8aee34e: Distribute Cotal's authored Agent Skills (`SKILL.md`), starting with `team-topology`, from one canonical source in the CLI package to every AI coding harness, with real central update and removal.

  - **Claude Code:** a skills-only `cotal-skills` plugin in the existing `cotal-mesh` marketplace, installed at user scope and independent of the mesh connector (it carries no code and no core dependency). Its plugin version is stamped from the running CLI release and `cotal setup` runs `claude plugin update`, so an upgrade actually replaces the cached skill; each plugin dir is rebuilt from an allowlist and swapped in, never merged, so no stale file rides in. It installs on first run and, fail-loud, on repeat runs, so upgraders are not left behind, and the install is verified via `claude plugin list --json` (exact id, scope/project, enabled, no errors, and expected version). `cotal status` gains a "Claude skills" row.
  - **Every other harness** (Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Windsurf/Devin): `cotal setup` reconciles the cross-vendor `~/.agents/skills/` directory at the file level, tracked by a validated manifest under `~/.cotal`. Cotal owns exactly each skill's `SKILL.md`: before overwriting a copy you have edited it copies your version into a fresh `SKILL.md.bak` slot (never overwriting an existing or third-party backup), and on removal deletes only that file (then the dir if it is left empty), never a whole directory, never a user's other files, and never a third-party skill. Every managed write (skill file and ownership manifest) goes through a stage-and-rename with an exclusively-created temp (so a hard-linked or symlinked path is replaced, never written through to an outside inode), and a malformed or corrupt manifest fails loud. `cotal status` reports current/stale/missing/retired for the drop and current/stale/missing/broken for the Claude plugin.
  - The website Agent Skills discovery index is generated from the same canonical files and reconciled (a removed skill stops being served/indexed); a forward bet on the draft RFC, which no shipping harness consumes yet.

  A corrupt or empty skills bundle fails loud rather than silently shipping zero skills.

- 02b3243: feat(secret-store): move SpaceAuth (the signing authority) behind the SecretStore seam

  The space trust bundle (`.cotal/auth/auth.json`) is the last and highest-blast-radius durable secret kind. It now flows through the pluggable `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition injects its own KMS/Vault store and no signing seed lands on the hosted disk.

  - New `@cotal-ai/workspace` API: `getSpaceAuth(store, expectedSpace?)`, `putSpaceAuth(store, auth)`, `deleteSpaceAuth(store)`, and `SPACE_AUTH_KEY` (`auth/auth.json`), byte-for-byte the current local path under `workspaceSecretStore`. `getSpaceAuth` validates via the new `@cotal-ai/core` `validateSpaceAuthForRead`, which accepts both a full trust bundle (fully chain-validated) and a stripped signer projection (the `mint --signer`/container form — account keys validated structurally), and never echoes stored seeds/JWTs/space labels in errors. `putSpaceAuth` is the single `sys.signingSeed` strip site.
  - `remintDaemonCreds(root, expectedSpace, store?, { preflight? })` reads the signer through the same resolved store as the daemon cred; `expectedSpace` is required and validated against it. It never overwrites the last-good daemon cred with an unproven one: proof is a broker `preflight` (the manager's live probe, which gates every candidate when supplied) OR authority continuity (the candidate is signed by the same account key as the current broker-accepted cred — what the offline `doctor auth --fix` relies on). A same-label alternate account (full or stripped) is neither, so it is refused rather than clobbering the last-good.
  - The manager reads its signer from the injected `ManagerOptions.secretStore` (`getSpaceAuth(this.secrets, this.space)`); `up`, `mint`, `backup`, `restore`, `doctor`, `spawn`, and the delivery dev-mint helper go through the store. `loadSpaceAuth` remains the sync FS reader for name-only/presence callers and the static-auth single-machine mint composition.
  - `cotal clean all` deletes `auth/auth.json` through the store as its absolute-last step, so a partial-failure reset re-runs against the correct space.

  Closes "no signing seed at rest on a hosted disk"; the remaining hosted gap is signer isolation (the seed is still decrypted in-process at the manager's uid), not custody.

### Patch Changes

- c3afdaa: fix(renewal): prove the broker accepted a re-signed daemon credential before reporting it adopted

  `cotal doctor auth` could report a renewal "adopted" that the broker never accepted (a false green). The daemon's credential-reload path now proves acceptance on a disposable preflight connection before it adopts, and the record + `doctor` verdict only ever claim what was proven:

  - The delivery-admin `reloadCreds` reply narrows to `brokerAccepted` (identity/iat/exp actually accepted) plus a best-effort `residentSwap`, never an unwitnessed "adopted".
  - The passive 75% renewal timer and the explicit reload share one single-flight transaction and both preflight before installing a candidate, so a rejected credential in the store can never strand the live connection.
  - The whole daemon-side transaction is deadline-bounded (under the manager's request bound) with a late-commit fence, so a hung store fails loud instead of a silent "no responder".
  - `cotal doctor auth` now exits non-zero and says so when the last renewal was refused by the broker, instead of letting cred-file health alone stand as healthy.
  - The ephemeral generation fingerprint used to bind the expected generation is redacted at the persistence boundary, so it never lands in `.cotal/renewal.json` or logs.

- 9e3fdd6: cli: make installed extensions discoverable. Bare `cotal ext` now lists the inventory instead of erroring; `cotal ext list` and the `cotal status` Extensions section lead with the install prefix and state it is a cotal-owned store kept separate from npm's global tree (which is why `npm list -g` never shows these); a new `cotal ext root` prints just the path for scripts, and `status` always renders the section with an explicit empty state. Discoverability only: where extensions install and how they upgrade is unchanged.
- 2ed747d: feat(secret-store): migrate the membership feed's rw credential onto the store seam with proven standing renewal

  The broker-sourced graph feed's data-account (rw) credential now moves as a full read/write/delete kind through the `SecretStore` seam, so a hosted composition can renew it end-to-end (KMS/Vault) the way `delivery.creds` already does. Local `cotal up` is byte-for-byte unchanged (the default is the workstation FS store).

  - The feed's rw connection adopts credentials the way the endpoint does: an async source read outside the (synchronous) authenticator, a preflight-proven cache, a 75%-of-lifetime renewal timer, and a single-flight transaction bounded by an absolute deadline. Its authenticator now only ever presents the last **broker-proven** credential, so an incidental reconnect can no longer present an unproven or broker-refused generation and strand the feed.
  - The renewal owner (the manager) and the daemon now share one `SecretStore`: `Manager` takes an optional `secretStore` (defaulting to the workstation FS store) that feeds `remintDaemonCreds` and every per-agent secret kind, and `startMembership` reads the rw credential through the injected store. A hosted composition that hands the manager and the delivery daemon the same store renews both daemon kinds without a restart.
  - `cotal up` writes, and `cotal clean all` deletes, `membership-rw.creds` through the seam (never a raw filesystem write/remove), matching the `delivery.creds` discipline.
  - `credsRenewalDelayMs` (the 75% renew-early convention) is shared from `identity` so the endpoint and the feed compute it identically.

- 9625ec6: Add `cotal update` to reconcile first-party connectors and extensions to one generation, report third-party extensions, and check or opt into a serialized, verified global CLI upgrade.
- 6960658: The web dashboard now ships and versions with the `cotal-ai` binary. Previously `@cotal-ai/web` was fetched separately on its own version line, so upgrading the CLI (`npm i -g cotal-ai@new`) left the dashboard stale, and the documented `cotal ext add @cotal-ai/web` could not cross the 0.x caret to reach the new release, leaving customers on an old dashboard with no clean way forward.

  web is now a bundled first-party extension alongside the connectors: it is carried inside the `cotal-ai` package and the boot reconcile installs and version-refreshes it from that bundled payload at the binary's own version. So `npm i -g cotal-ai@X` brings the dashboard to X automatically and offline on the normal upgrade path, exactly like the connectors (a deliberate operator pin or a rollback is the operator's choice, same as any connector). To make this possible, web is repackaged to be self-contained — its marked/DOMPurify browser builds are copied into its own `dist` and served from there instead of resolving `node_modules` at runtime — so it seeds with no runtime dependencies.

  The bundle path is hardened so the update stays clean and verifiable: the prepack asserts every seeded payload's `name` and `version` match the umbrella (the `fixed` group keeps them lockstep), the reconcile verifies each (re)installed extension is recorded, on disk, and at the generation version before it stamps success (a version-skewed payload fails loud), and web publishes a `vendor-manifest.json` (name/version/license/sha512) of its bundled marked/DOMPurify so the shipped browser libs stay auditable.

### Minor Changes

- 5491661: v0.4 endpoint control surface: a breaking wire revision (SPEC section 13).

  Adds the endpoint control surface: the `ep` request rails and grant grammar, the
  message envelope and error catalog, the callable-service verbs, and the session
  and virtual-endpoint composites. Deletes the v0.3 `ctl` rail (the hard cut).
  Requires nats-server 2.12 or newer, since the auth marker store uses native
  per-message TTL; clients read the server version from the pre-auth INFO and fail
  loud below the floor.

  Completes the agent lifecycle end to end: registration, admission, despawn,
  retirement, and safe name reuse, backed by a lifecycle registry, a credential
  ledger, and a retirement barrier. Durables are keyed by lifecycle uid, so a
  manager-resumed agent recovers its original incarnation rather than re-minting,
  and readiness is incarnation-exact. The connectors forward the lifecycle uid into
  spawned children so a child joins as its intended incarnation.

  From v0.4 an AgentCard MUST advertise `protocolVersion "0.4"`; a participant that
  omits it is treated as pre-0.4 and is not addressed on the endpoint rails.

Local `cotal up` is unchanged (the workspace `.cotal`-rooted filesystem store lands byte-for-byte on the existing paths); a hosted composition injects its own backend via `runAuthService`/`runDelivery`. `AuthProvider` methods now take a caller-composed `store`, and the new required `deprovisionSecrets` plus `clean all`'s seam-first ordering make a full local reset safe against split authority.

A foreground exit now also retires the agent's creds and broker footprint, mirroring the manager's despawn.

### Patch Changes

- 5b2863a: feat: `cotal clean` - one configurable cleanup verb (history / store / all)

  `cotal down` deliberately preserves the on-disk JetStream store, so stale broker state (e.g.
  durables minted by an older, incompatible Cotal generation) survived every down/up cycle and made
  a new-generation `cotal spawn` fail with `consumer already exists`. `cotal clean <history|store|all>
--force` is the operator reset:

  - **history**: purge the retained message backlog on the running broker (channels, plus DMs with
    `--dms`) over the least-privilege purger cred; `cotal history clear` stays as a thin alias.
  - **store**: delete the stopped mesh's JetStream store (`.cotal/nats` or `--store-dir`).
  - **all**: store + the space identity (`.cotal/auth`), every locally persisted cred/marker tied to
    it, crash residue a normal `down` would have swept, and this root's registry entries; the next
    `up` mints a fresh identity.

  Hardening that shipped with it: one shared pidfile probe for `down`/`clean`/`status` (pid > 0
  only; EPERM reads as alive), `down` no longer erases the record of a process it cannot stop nor
  presents a failed stop as clean, registry teardown keys on the canonicalized project root
  everywhere (a named open mesh can no longer delete another mesh's entry), and stale-store failures
  plus `cotal status` now name the reset recipe.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 9061d0e: feat: per-user authentication (owner+actor identity, IdP login, credential death)

  Add per-user auth as a first-class mesh mode. A mesh brought up with `cotal up --user-auth --idp <url>`
  authenticates humans against an identity provider and issues short-lived, ledger-scoped bearers through an
  auth callout, in place of long-lived static credential files.

  - **owner+actor identity.** An instance's wire identity becomes the two-token principal `(owner, actor)`:
    every subject carries the sender as `<owner>.<actor>`, and grants, durables, presence, and `from.id`
    re-key onto the pair. Cross-owner and same-owner cross-actor forge/read isolation is enforced by the
    broker; the connection nkey survives only as the transport credential.
  - **Login and delegation.** Humans sign in with `cotal login --idp <url>` (device-code); operators grant
    access with `cotal actor grant`. Agents are spawned under the signed-in human as managed `(owner, actor)`
    children whose scope is a subset of the spawner's (the delegation envelope rule). Agent identities live in
    a separate managed-actor ledger space, exchanged via their own per-agent secret, so they outlive the
    human's login session.
  - **Credential death.** Every managed credential is now lifetime-bounded, with supervisor and delivery
    standing renewal, `$SYS` rotation-renewal, live connection eviction on revoke, and a `cotal doctor auth`
    repair surface. On a user-auth mesh, static agent creds are retired (the flip): revocation closes the live
    window at the next connect.
  - **Elevated operator surfaces.** `cotal web`, `console`, `history clear`, `channels set/default`, and
    `spawn -f` come online in user mode via server-authored elevated view bearers, minted only by the
    signed-in human exchange and gated on ledger scope (`admin` / `spawn`); `ps` and `status` are
    owner-domain scoped.
  - **Connectors.** Add the `cotal_docs` tool (version-exact Cotal docs the agent reads natively) and an
    opaque `launchOptions` raw passthrough for the Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes adapters.

  - Make `cotal setup` configure-only: it checks prerequisites, installs the Claude plugin and web dashboard extension, seeds one default persona, and keeps the guided david/sven/me team behind `--demo` or `--full`.
  - Have `cotal up` own the local stack (broker, delivery daemon, and manager), with safer teardown, manifest launch handling, and automatic free-port selection for default-port collisions.
  - Collapse foreground and detached launches into one `spawn` grammar, with hardened manager readiness behavior and default persona / default agent environment overrides.
  - Strengthen auth, credential lifetime/rotation, delivery, and OpenCode cancellation handling.
  - Refresh README and getting-started onboarding around `npx cotal-ai setup`, then `cotal up --detach`, `cotal web`, `cotal spawn`, and `cotal down`.

### Minor Changes

- 1bcc154: feat: manager least-privilege — no allow-all credential — plus session resume

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — the message
  schema is unchanged and `protocolVersion` stays `0.2`; this release is about who the manager is
  allowed to be on the broker, plus a new way to bring an existing session into the mesh.

  **Security — the manager is no longer an all-powerful credential**

  Until now every manager action ran under a single, blanket `manager` credential that could do almost
  anything on the broker — read any DM, tamper with any stream, publish as any agent. That credential
  is **gone**. Manager work now runs under a set of small, purpose-built credentials, each able to do
  only its own job and nothing else:

  - The **always-on supervisor** can serve control requests, hold its lease, and publish presence — but
    it **cannot read anyone's messages, create arbitrary consumers, or delete/purge streams**.
  - **Spawning, teardown, and history-purge** each run on their own short-lived, tightly scoped
    credential that exists only for that operation.
  - The **CLI verbs** (`send`, `spawn`, `channels`, `up`, `join`, `down -f`, …) each connect as the
    least-privileged profile for the job — an operator posts only as itself and can never forge another
    agent.

  The practical effect: a leaked or compromised manager credential can no longer read message bodies or
  meddle with other agents' streams — the blast radius is contained to exactly what that one credential
  was scoped to. Control replies are bounded per caller, `cotal join` now self-provisions its own inbox
  (no more `ConsumerNotFound` on a fresh console), and `cotal down` tears down all of a space's streams
  and buckets rather than a subset.

  **New — resume an existing session into the mesh**

  `cotal spawn --resume <id>` and `cotal start --resume <id>` fork an existing `claude` session — its
  deep context and long transcript — into the mesh, instead of always starting an agent from scratch.
  It **forks, never hijacks**: the meshed agent gets a _new_ session branched off that transcript, and
  the original is left untouched. Connectors that can't support this (`opencode`, `hermes`) are
  **rejected up front, before any provisioning**, with a clear error rather than a half-provisioned
  space.

  **Fixes & UX**

  - **`cotal attach` shows the real screen on (re)attach to a full-screen agent.** Re-attaching, or
    attaching late, now reconstructs and repaints the agent's current screen instead of leaving you on
    a blank or partial one.
  - **Mouse-wheel scrolling works in full-screen agents over `cotal attach`.**
  - **The `pty` runtime fails loud under Bun.** It isn't supported there, so it now says so clearly
    instead of misbehaving silently.
  - **Removed the `face:` viewer that had leaked from the frontier-faces example into shared connector
    code**, so an OpenCode persona with a `face:` field boots normally. Face rendering lives entirely
    in `examples/04-frontier-faces`.

  **Migration — re-`up` spaces created before this release**

  The supervisor now records its lease in a per-space manager bucket that older spaces don't have. A
  space that was brought up on an earlier version must be re-`up`'d (a fresh `cotal up` is fine);
  otherwise the supervisor throws `stream not found` on its first lease write. Nothing on the message
  wire changed, so running agents and clients are otherwise unaffected.

### Minor Changes

- cce0a6a: feat: mesh manifests, the tmux runtime, and a new `@cotal-ai/workspace` layer

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays `0.2`; this release is all tooling, packaging, and hardening. The new publishable
  `@cotal-ai/workspace` package joins the lockstep group.

  **New**

  - **Mesh manifests — describe and launch a whole topology from one `cotal.yaml` (`kind: Mesh`).**
    The file is organized by channel (each lists `subscribe`/`allowSubscribe`/`allowPublish` —
    Cotal's native verbs, holding agent names); a top `agents:` table resolves each name to a persona
    (bare path / file + overrides / fully inline) and a connector (`agent:`, per-agent or a top-level
    default — no silent default). Under `personaPermissions: include` a persona's own channel grants are
    inherited for channels the manifest doesn't declare.

    - `cotal up -f <cotal.yaml>` brings up a **fresh** mesh — broker + seeded channels + booted agents —
      and owns the whole space (`cotal down` tears it down). A broker already reachable at the
      manifest's address is refused with a redirect to `spawn -f`, never re-seeded as fresh.
    - `cotal spawn -f <cotal.yaml>` deploys a manifest **additively** onto a mesh that's already
      running: brand-new channels are seeded and owned, already-present ones are left untouched
      (`exists-unmanaged`), and exactly what it created is written to a creation-only ledger
      (`.cotal/manifests/<runId>.json`). A re-declared agent whose policy changed is **stale** and
      exits non-zero unless `--allow-stale <names>`; unmanaged actors with access to a declared channel
      are surfaced as a SECURITY warning.
    - `cotal down -f <cotal.yaml>` (or `--run <id>`) tears down **only** what a `spawn -f` run created —
      never foreign actors on the shared mesh. The ledger is treated as untrusted input and validated
      whole before any deletion; an owned agent is stopped only when its recorded name **and** id match
      the live one, cred paths are derived from the auth root and deleted without following symlinks,
      and an owned channel is removed only when no other members remain. Local-only: same checkout/host
      that created the run.
    - `cotal topology view -f <cotal.yaml>` validates a manifest and renders its access graph
      (per-channel and per-agent subscribe/read/post, persona-inherited scopes, warnings) — read-only,
      no broker needed. `--dry-run` previews `up -f`/`spawn -f` and mutates nothing.

    Resolved agents boot via a transient, non-authoritative launch artifact under `.cotal/run/` (no
    generated personas in `.cotal/agents/`), handed to the manager through a new **operator-only**
    `launch` control op that reads the run spec by id, never an arbitrary path.

  - **`@cotal-ai/tmux` — a tmux Runtime and `TerminalLayout` extension.** Each agent spawned via
    `--runtime tmux` gets its own window in a shared per-space tmux session, with P3 `env -i`
    isolation; a `TerminalLayout` provider lets `cotal setup` open and close tmux windows from the
    ambient `$TMUX` session. Self-registers on import (`import "@cotal-ai/tmux"`), exactly like
    `@cotal-ai/cmux`. `cotal setup` now offers a tmux demo when run inside a tmux session.

  - **Web graph — hide offline members by default**, with a toggle to show them. Backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership.

  **Architecture**

  - **New `@cotal-ai/workspace` package — the machine-local workstation layer, split out of
    `@cotal-ai/core`.** Core is now strictly the wire standard (endpoint, subjects, message types,
    extension contracts) and depends on nothing else in the repo; the `~/.cotal` mesh registry, target
    resolution, preflight, `.cotal/` auth-path I/O, and the `cotal …` command-copy renderer now live in
    `@cotal-ai/workspace`. Dependencies flow one way:
    `examples → implementations → workspace → core ← (peer) extensions`. A `smoke:core-boundary` guard
    (in `pnpm check` and CI) fails the build if core ever imports workspace.

    **Migration (importers only — no runtime/wire change):** `mesh-registry`, `mesh-target`,
    `preflight`, and the auth-path helpers (`authDir`/`findCotalRoot`/`loadSpaceAuth`/`saveSpaceAuth`)
    now import from `@cotal-ai/workspace` instead of `@cotal-ai/core`. Mesh-target failures throw a
    typed `MeshTargetError` (with a `code` and structured `details`); detect it with the exported
    `isWorkspaceTargetError(e)` guard rather than `instanceof`. The `cotal …`-flavored error copy is
    rendered through a single `renderWorkspaceError(...)` over a `target | preflight | reachable`
    union.

  - **`cotal ps` / `start` / `stop` / `attach` now resolve their broker from the mesh registry** — the
    same way `send` / `channels` / `console` / `web` and the manifest verbs already do — instead of
    silently defaulting to `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`. `--space <name>` finds the recorded broker (and
    mints the privileged `manager` cred from that mesh's own recorded root); `--server` stays an
    override and `--creds` a raw off-registry escape hatch. The shared mesh-target preflight is now
    used by both the transient commands and the manager control commands.

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager forwards the resolved channel ACL to spawned connectors**, so a manifest-spawned agent
    actually subscribes to the channels its persona grants (no missing `COTAL_SUBSCRIBE`).
  - **Never prune a recorded mesh on an explicit `--server` override** — an off-registry target no
    longer evicts the registry entry it didn't come from.
  - **Web graph correctness** — mode chips filter persistent edges (not just animation), hidden nodes
    stay hidden under the visibility filters, and dashboard assets are served with
    `cache-control: no-cache` so the UI doesn't get pinned to a stale build.
  - **`cotal attach` restores terminal modes on detach** — focus-reporting is reset and stdout writes
    are guarded against a dead pipe, so detaching no longer leaves the terminal in a wedged state.
  - **Security hardening** — symlink-safe run directories, launch-policy re-validation at spawn,
    tightened launch-spec validation, and the operator-only manager `launch` op (above).
  - **CI** — the security/protocol smoke suite (`smoke:ci`) and the mesh-resolution / spawn-from-anywhere
    / core-boundary smokes are gated in the `check` workflow.

  **Runtime defaults (carried from the tmux work)**

  The built-in `tmux` manager runtime is gone — `tmux` is resolved from `@cotal-ai/tmux`, exactly like
  `cmux`. The default `auto` mode is deterministic `pty`; tmux and cmux are never auto-selected. Choose
  them explicitly with `--runtime tmux`/`cmux`, which fails loud with a clear
  `"import @cotal-ai/<runtime>"` error if the matching extension isn't imported — no silent fallback to
  pty.

### Minor Changes

- a6a0a8d: feat: agent orientation, spawn-from-anywhere, live space graph, model-aware spawning

  A coordinated minor across the workspace (lockstep `fixed` group). No wire break — `protocolVersion`
  stays 0.2.

  **New**

  - **`cotal_orientation`** — a self/context card MCP tool: an agent's identity, the channels it can
    read and post to, its capabilities, available tools, and who's present. Claude Code, OpenCode, and
    Hermes connectors all point new agents at it on boot for the same first-turn orientation.
  - **Spawn from any directory** — `cotal spawn` resolves a running mesh from a registry, so agents can
    be spawned outside the project directory. The registry self-prunes space-mismatched and stale
    `current` entries; its dir is locked to `0700` so space names aren't world-readable.
  - **Model- and harness-aware spawning** — `cotal start --model` overrides the model, the harness CLI
    is preflighted before spawn, and the harness/model knobs are shared across both spawn doors (CLI
    `cotal spawn` and MCP `cotal_spawn`).
  - **Live space graph** — a force-directed graph view of a space in the web UI, backed by
    broker-sourced authoritative channel membership (offline agents drop from the graph immediately).

  **Fixes & hardening**

  - **Manager persona spawn is fail-loud and ACL-correct.** A spawn (`start` op / `cotal_spawn` /
    roster boot) now treats its argument as a persona ref (a filename in `.cotal/agents`), takes the
    mesh identity from the file's `name:` (auto-numbered on collision), fails loud on a missing persona,
    and always provisions read/post ACLs from the loaded persona. Previously a miss silently minted
    default creds (read `general` only, default-deny publish, no capabilities), so a persona spawned by
    display name, a typo, or a renamed file became a live agent with silently-wrong ACLs.
  - **Mesh-connect resolution unified** — `web`/`console`/`join` (and the transient commands) route
    through a shared `resolveMeshTarget` + preflight: the recorded server/mode is honored (open ≠ auth),
    the `--server`+`--space` raw escape works again for open remote meshes, the `channels` subcommand is
    validated, and a silent wrong-mesh fallback is refused rather than connecting to the wrong broker.
  - **`cotal web` no longer holds the account signing seed.** The dashboard used to keep the space
    `SpaceAuth` (which can mint _any_ identity/role) in scope for the whole session, re-minting on every
    channel delete — a compromise of the loopback process could mint anything for the account. It now
    pre-mints one scoped `manager` cred at startup for the lone write path (channel delete) and lets the
    seed fall out of scope, shrinking the blast radius from "mint anything" to "purge channels as one
    manager". Open / `--creds` modes are unaffected (no seed; they use the connection creds).

### Patch Changes

  - @cotal-ai/core@0.7.0

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- ba5e622: feat(delivery): server-side delivery daemon for the Plane-3 durable backstop, + auth-by-default

  Extracts the durable backstop (the offline catch-up tier) out of the manager into a standalone,
  least-privilege, server-side **delivery daemon** (`@cotal-ai/delivery`, the `deliver` command). The
  manager is now lifecycle-only (spawn/despawn/stop/attach/ps); the daemon owns all of Plane-3 — the
  fan-out writer + trusted reader, the durable-membership registry, the runtime durable join/leave/list
  ops (on a new `ctl.delivery` control service), activation catch-up, and a single-flight lease — and
  re-authorizes durable delivery against a durable read-ACL registry. Live channel reads are unchanged
  (native NATS, broker-enforced). No wire break (`protocolVersion` stays 0.2).

  - The daemon is part of the server: `cotal up` starts it by default and it is coupled to the broker
    (it exits if the broker is gone; `cotal down` / `cotal up` shutdown stop it).
  - **The mesh is now JWT-authed by default** — `cotal setup`/`go`/`up` bring up an authed mesh with the
    durable backstop; pass `--open` for the previous frictionless open, live-only mesh.
  - `cotal_channels` reports honest durable-delivery health (membership + lease aware).

  Hardened over multiple review rounds (sender-bound `ctl.delivery` replies, reconnect-safe responder +
  KV handles, ACL-independent leave so revocation closes the §7 boundary, signer-free daemon runtime,
  responder-after-bind readiness, pid-bound cutover marker), each with a guard smoke.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 58f2d41: Self-serve channel join + durable backstop (SPEC v0.3 delivery rebuild)

  Agents whose read ACL allows a channel now join/leave its **live** feed themselves over a native NATS core subscription — manager-free, broker-enforced by `sub.allow` (join = subscribe, leave = unsubscribe). A manager-hosted **Plane-3 durable backstop** (a privileged fan-out writer → a trusted reader that re-authorizes every entry against the current read ACL and membership interval → a per-member DELIVER durable the agent acks natively, SPEC §8) ensures a post still reaches a busy or offline agent on its next turn. Channel membership moves to a privileged cursored KV registry (`cotal_members_<space>`), and channels carry explicit `live`/`durable` delivery classes (default `durable`; a space with no manager is live-only).

  The legacy per-instance `chat_<id>` live-tail durable and the mediated filter-move are removed — one clean model with no coexistence code. This is a wire-protocol change (SPEC bumped to v0.3): new and old clients do not interoperate on channel delivery.

### Minor Changes

- df8e64c: Add `cotal-ai` — a guided, two-tier setup. The composition root (`bin/`) ships as the
  publishable `cotal-ai` package, so `npm i -g cotal-ai` / `npx cotal-ai <cmd>` works (bare
  `cotal` runs `setup`). The **first run** is a narrated, branded flow (`@clack/prompts` UI,
  wordmark splash, a live pane that streams the mesh booting) that checks prerequisites, locates
  the NATS server (bundled platform binary via `@eplightning/nats-server-*`, or one already on
  PATH), then a **connector picker** (Claude / OpenCode — only Claude installs a plugin; OpenCode
  auto-wires at spawn), and writes two default Cotal experts you can chat with — **david — the
  engineer** (how it works) and **sven — the guide** (what to build) — plus **me**, the session
  you drive. The finale is cmux-aware: inside cmux it opens a manager tab that pre-spawns david/sven
  into their own tabs alongside a console + driving session, otherwise a background manager
  pre-spawns them and the terminal is handed to your session. **Later runs** are a compact
  ensure+status card; `cotal setup --full` forces the full flow, and `cotal setup --yes` runs it
  non-interactively (agents/CI) — installs the plugin, writes the experts, starts the web, and exits
  non-zero with the log path on failure. Each failed interactive step offers a Claude handoff
  (skippable with `COTAL_SKIP_ASSIST=1`) that carries the failure context and resumes setup on
  `/exit`.

  Supporting changes across the stack:

  - **core** — `Connector.pluginRoot` (find a connector's installable plugin assets without
    importing the extension), `LaunchOpts.prompt` (an auto-submitted first message), a `TerminalLayout`
    extension contract (a host-side, not-wire contract: open/close editor tabs from a backend-agnostic
    `Tab` — panes as argv + an optional split — resolved by name from the registry), and `findCotalRoot`
    (walk up to `.cotal/`, so `cotal` runs from any subdirectory).
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_purge`, an agent-driven request that has the manager clear the
    space's retained chat backlog (the privileged `STREAM.PURGE` regular agents are denied).
  - **manager** — pre-spawn teammates at startup (`cotal cmux --spawn a,b`, staggered on presence),
    the `purge` control op (native JetStream purge), and a WS attach endpoint.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `TerminalLayout` provider (plus `listWorkspaces`/`workspaceRefs` on
    the driver) that translates the agnostic `Tab` into cmux's native layout, so `cotal setup`
    opens/closes cmux tabs through the registry without depending on the package or building any
    cmux-shaped layout itself.
  - **connector-claude-code** — MCP isolation for spawned sessions (`--strict-mcp-config` +
    `--mcp-config`, channel ref `server:cotal`), `prompt` passthrough, and the plugin manifest files
    shipped in the published package.

  Adds `cotal up --detach` + `cotal down` for a background mesh. `cotal up` now pre-creates the
  space's JetStream streams + KV buckets for **both** modes (open connects without creds), so
  anything that touches a stream before an endpoint has joined — `cotal spawn`'s DM-inbox
  provisioning, `cotal_purge`, `history clear` — works on a fresh open mesh instead of failing with
  StreamNotFound. When run via `npx` without a global
  `cotal`, setup offers to `npm i -g cotal-ai` (default yes; non-interactive takes the default),
  best-effort — and the status-card hints render the right prefix (`cotal` / `npx cotal-ai` /
  `pnpm cotal`) for how you ran it.

### Minor Changes

- 73b030f: Add the `cotal_feedback` sender: a connector tool (always exposed) and a `cotal feedback "<summary>"` CLI mode. With a `COTAL_FEEDBACK_KEY` feedback routes to the keyed broker intake as before; without one it goes to the public intake at `https://cotal.ai/v1/feedback`, which requires a contact email (`COTAL_FEEDBACK_EMAIL` → git config → ask). `COTAL_FEEDBACK_URL` overrides either URL for self-hosted intakes.
- 739649a: Spaces model, operator console, cmux onboarding, personas, and faces (PRs #15–#20).

  - **cli** — a lazygit-style Ink `console` over a shared `MeshView`, plus `setup`/`supervise`/`cmux`/`demo` onboarding.
  - **manager** — registry-resolved runtimes (the manager no longer depends on cmux), graceful stop, and `definePersona`.
  - **cmux** — a self-registering `cmux` `RuntimeProvider` with real teardown.
  - **connector-core** — `cotal_persona` and `cotal_despawn` tools.
  - **connector-opencode** — an optional animated face viewer (avatar id read from the agent file's `meta.face`).
  - **core** — space discovery (`listSpaces`/`deleteSpace`), a pluggable `Runtime` extension contract, `DEFAULT_SPACE`, `saveAgentFile`, and a generic `meta` passthrough bag (kept a patch to avoid force-majoring the connectors that peer-depend on core).
