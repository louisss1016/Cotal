## 0.50.0

### Minor Changes

- cca2020: Keep the Jcode tool relay socket out of the shared temp directory, and contain self-test cleanups

  The Jcode connector placed its control socket at the top level of `/tmp`. Anything that empties
  that directory, a distribution's periodic cleaner or a self-test whose recursive cleanup escaped
  its own root, unlinked the control path of every live seat at once. The hosts kept listening on
  the now-nameless inodes, so every `cotal_*` call from those sessions failed with `connect ENOENT`,
  and the only recovery was a respawn, which discards the session's context.

  The socket now lives in a per-launch owner-only directory the host creates and removes with the
  launch, so a top-level sweep does not reach it. A host whose socket path disappears anyway
  re-binds at the same path within a poll interval and records it in the seat's private log, so a
  deletion costs a reconnect instead of a respawn.

  The escape that triggered it is closed at its own end too. A self-test's recursive cleanup may now
  only remove the exact path its `mkdtemp` returned, and only where that path resolves strictly
  beneath the base it was created in. A cleanup handed anything else refuses and exits 2 rather than
  deleting, so a mutant that makes a directory helper return a parent can no longer reach another
  process's files. That rule lives in `scripts/mutation-command-safety.mjs`, next to the existing rule
  bounding what a mutation config may execute: both bound what a config taken from disk can reach.

### Patch Changes

- 7875182: A Jcode seat whose soft interrupts time out now keeps consuming its queue, and stops reporting itself healthy while it is not.

  Peer messages that arrive while a Jcode session is busy are handed to it mid-turn. When that handoff got no reply, nothing else ever looked at the queue: it was served only by a new message arriving or the session going idle, and on a busy seat neither has to happen. Messages piled up behind a seat that was working normally and answering direct questions, and the seat was indistinguishable from a wedged one. Measured on a live seat: 27 messages held for 13.8 hours.

  A seat now serves its own queue on a schedule rather than waiting for an event. If the mid-turn handoff stops answering, the queued messages are delivered as an ordinary turn instead, which needs no reply from it, so they arrive late rather than never. Nothing is dropped and nothing is delivered twice.

  `cotal_connection_status` also stops calling such a seat `ready`. A bound session with a live transport whose queued messages have made no progress for ten minutes now reports `stalled`, alongside how long the queue has gone without committing anything, and `cotal_reconnect` says plainly when rebuilding the connection did not deliver them, instead of answering with a bare success over an untouched queue.

## 0.49.0

### Minor Changes

- 36d1779: Issued authority and run admission (SPEC 13.15, 14.8). A static credential is now an issuance: the issuer records its permission ceiling as evidence under a fresh generation before the material exists, its endpoint rows ride the versioned `ep.v1` rail with that generation pinned beside the caller triple, and a connected client reads its generation from an issuer-written accepted row. A hosted workflow run is admitted under the starting caller's resolved ceiling, recorded once per run in a dedicated admission store the driver cannot write, checked before every channel effect (wait open, fetch, recorded re-read, conclave writes), and revoked by an independent create-only marker that ends open waits at their next poll and refuses resume, takeover and reconcile. `run-start` on the legacy rail is refused with `permission-denied` and the `ai.cotal.ep.unbound-caller-authority` detail. `cotal run start --local` takes `--admit-read` and `--admit-publish` (required) and `cotal run revoke <runId> --local --by <who> --reason <text>` writes the marker. Three new per-space stores (`cotal_issued_`, `cotal_accepted_`, `cotal_admission_`), immutable at the broker: the admission and accepted stores are write-once per key, the evidence store is append-only and read first-on-key, and all three refuse rollup headers, message deletes and purges, so a holder of its own key row can neither widen nor erase what was recorded. Two new one-shot profiles (`issuer`, `run-admitter`), an admission read on the run mediator and operator profiles, and `COTAL_ACCEPTED_TOKEN` on every connector's spawn environment. Breaking pre-1.0 authority change.

### Patch Changes

- 4826da2: Start a Jcode seat whose private home has an empty `sessions/` directory instead of dying as
  `startup failed (unknown)`. The connector skips the panicking list call when that directory is
  empty, redials after any listing death, and names the panic text and sessions path when recovery
  cannot create a session.
- cd74517: Prove Jcode pre-join readiness on the orientation `tool_done` event as it arrives. A seat that
  already called `cotal_orientation` now joins even when that proof turn stays open. The timeout
  outcome names whether the call was observed, and teardown no longer kills a functional session
  just because `turn_done` is still outstanding.
- 61d08ab: Verify the active Jcode model and provider route before applying `--variant`. A route that accepts
  reasoning effort still receives the requested tier before its first turn. A route without that
  capability now fails with an explicit unsupported-capability diagnostic instead of a tier refusal.

## 0.48.2

### Patch Changes

- Prove pre-join readiness on the orientation `tool_done` event as it arrives, without waiting for
  `turn_done`. A seat that already called `cotal_orientation` and then kept working used to be
  killed at the bound because the Harness `run()` promise only resolves when the turn ends. The
  timeout line now names whether that call was observed. Teardown still destroys a seat that never
  called the tool; it no longer destroys a functional session solely because the proof turn is
  still open.

- 102da9b: Keep a Jcode seat alive when the model is busy at post-join, and retain its startup prompt until the Harness request is invoked.

  The post-join mesh notice is sent with `noReply: true`, which routes through `requestOk` and
  throws when the harness answers with an error frame. A model still busy at that moment refused
  the notice and took the whole launch down, leaving a seat that had joined and then died. The
  notice is now sent inside a try/catch that records the failure to the seat's connector log and
  carries on, so a refused notice costs the notice and not the session. `noReply` stays on it: the
  readiness assertion binds the request frame, which the harness logs before it replies.

  The spawn kickoff is now owned from startup until the `turnClient.run(...)` invocation boundary.
  If either pre-send guard finds the resumed session busy or reconnecting, the kickoff remains pending
  and the idle or recovered bridge drives it without needing an inbox wake. Its composition stays the
  same as the old override path: channel briefing first when needed, then the kickoff, then any pending
  run-turn text; automatic inbox traffic is not folded into or acknowledged by the kickoff turn. The
  kickoff is consumed immediately before `run(...)`, so a post-dispatch close never causes a guessed
  retry. The SDK resolves its acceptance wait on acknowledgement, timeout, and close, so exactly-once
  model execution after an ambiguous dispatch cannot be established locally; stronger guarantees
  require protocol deduplication or confirmation by effect.

  Preserve the deferred automatic-inbox wake across the kickoff, so ordinary `dnd` traffic buffered
  before startup reaches the following turn without another message. Quiet traffic stays pull-only.
  Recovery tests now hold a steering acknowledgement across a native state change, exercise an error
  followed by a connection close, and report a missing kickoff through its named assertion.

  Also repairs two shared jcode smoke guards that were latently broken and are only selected once
  a change touches this suite:

  - `jcode-model-refusals.json` declared a persistence mutation whose named red sat behind an
    earlier connector-log assertion, so it could never print. Removing the one shared write stops
    every diagnostic being persisted, so that mutation now names the first cell it actually
    reddens, and a second, narrower mutation drops only the startup fatal line's persistence while
    leaving its stderr copy, which is what proves the original per-seat claim.
  - `provider readiness refusal names its code and rejected model parameter` matched the provider
    code and rejected model id anywhere in the host's stderr. The pre-join readiness diagnostic
    already contains both, so the cell passed with the classified render removed and could not show
    the suite reached it. It now also requires the classified line in the seat's connector log.

### Patch Changes

- d967f76: Bound the Jcode connector's pre-join `cotal_orientation` proof so a heavy persona cannot keep a seat alive and unreachable. A turn that overruns the declared three-minute window now exits `readiness_timeout` instead of working with no mesh presence. That teardown kills the private Jcode tree and discards the in-flight turn; nothing from it is recovered. The connector log still names the gate while the proof is running, and a later outcome line names what happened: proved (with or without a spawn `--prompt`), provider refusal, or timeout. A hang that never returns and never hits the bound has no outcome line.

## 0.42.0

### Minor Changes

- a87709c: Every cotal-lang effect now performs on the mesh: the durable-action group is built end to end and
  the not-yet-durable seam is gone.

  `spawn` submits a real manager goal and returns the allocated seat's handle, and meters the
  agent's `permits` (`turns`, `wallClock`; the turn that would exceed one is L4001, and a budget the
  host cannot meter is refused at spawn); `conclave` opens a scoped sub-team as durable membership
  rows; `ask` parks schema-checked pauses answered through `cotal run answer` and tells the agent
  over the turn relay, one relay per attempt carrying the schema, the attempt and the previous
  refusal, which every connector's intake renders with the answer command; `monitor` registers the
  handle on its journal entry and `wait(down)` reads a monitored incarnation's death off presence
  liveness, refusing an agent nobody monitored.
  `turn` rides a new pull-shaped manager relay: the manager serves `turn` (targeted, the
  despawn/input reach) plus `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` (self reach, manager contract revision
  10), holds the payload on the goal-index note, pins the goal to the seat's incarnation, and denies
  at a goal-bound deadline hold; the seat side (all connectors) pulls pending turns, surfaces them
  two-phase into host context, auto-yields `done` when the host turn ends, and yields `blocked` or
  `handoff` through the new `cotal_yield` tool; the run client renders context with pending notices,
  arms its own pause on the acceptance's deadline as the L4003 authority, watches presence as the
  L4002 authority (a death the manager marks on the deadline terminal reads the same way), and
  honors handoffs (L4005/L4004 validation, the `handoffFrom` goal chain); the manager shows a seat
  one turn at a time. The relay holds on an auth mesh: the agent baseline gains the self-mode
  `turn-pending` and `turn-yield` rows, the operator seat-write set (`control-caller-admin`, the
  `admin` capability) gains `turn` beside `input`, and the manager mints the deadline hold's
  schedule over its serve connection and owner-expires the hold once due instead of reading a
  fire it holds no grant for. `wait(replied)` observes the run's own turn terminals as a level, and never a
  turn the run itself ended without an accepted yield. A `spawn` may bind a logical worktree: the
  validator rejects two literal-worktree spawns in one concurrent scope (L3022, named branch
  functions included) and the runtime claims a tree before it submits, refusing a second spawn into
  a tree held by a live seat or by a spawn in flight (L4008), with sequential reuse the moment the
  holder's presence lapses. A spawn refused at accept is L4000 (L4001 for seat capacity) and one
  whose seat never came up is L4002; an `ask` whose deadline passes with no conforming record is
  L4006; a fork copies a spawn that said `onFork: "adopt"` and refuses one that would have to
  respawn (L5019). The run driver re-issues
  recorded-but-undischarged cancellations at adoption, so recovery does not wait for completion to
  release a dead loser's seat, pause, or tree. A migration's `--adopt <handle>` hands the orphaned
  seat to the edited program's next spawn of that persona, and `--release <handle>` despawns it at
  commit through the run's own discharge; both name the agent the step spawned, and a spawn that
  produced none is an orphan like a sleep; the adopting spawn binds the orphaned spawn's goal as
  its own, so a resume re-reads the seat and a cancellation despawns it. A turn accept the manager
  cannot finish unwinds to a failed terminal on its bound goal, and a retry of it is refused naming
  that terminal. The delivery daemon hosts the checkpoint timer writer, so mediated deadlines fire
  with no suite pump.

### Minor Changes

- 005aa61: connector-jcode: keep a seat name launchable after the seat is stopped or reaped.

  The short socket alias at `/tmp/jc-<hash>/home` is derived from the seat home, so one seat name
  reuses one path for the life of the machine. A launch handed that path back on teardown while a
  Jcode server the dead lifecycle left running was still using it as its `JCODE_HOME`, that server
  re-created the path as a real directory, and refusing a non-symlink there retired the name for
  good: every later launch of it failed before Jcode started, reporting `(unknown)` and pointing at a
  private log the failure had never reached.

  The alias is now reclaimed rather than refused. Each launch also records its identity nonce and its
  host process in the private home, and the seat's next launch stops the Jcode tree that record names
  once the recorded host is provably gone, so a lifecycle killed without its teardown no longer holds
  the seat's runtime directory for five minutes. A tree whose connector is still alive is left to
  Jcode's own runtime-directory lock. Failures preparing that private state now report a
  `private_state` code instead of `unknown`.

## 0.39.1

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- 34ff272: `cotal run`, the workflow-run operator surface, self-registered by `@cotal-ai/runtime` and composed
  into the `cotal` binary: `start --file <program>` drives a new run on the mesh handler, `resume
<runId> --file <program>` takes an existing run over and drives it to quiescence, `ps` lists an
  endpoint's run records (state, holder, journal high-water, fork lineage), `journal <runId>` prints
  the durable step journal, and `answer <runId> <stepKey> --by <who> [--value <json>]` resolves an
  open checkpoint through the run driver, presenting as the arming holder read back from the
  checkpoint record (resume is holder-bound). One raw connection per invocation against the resolved
  mesh target; the journal's result bound is taken from the broker's own max_payload.

  `docs/workflows.md` gains an "Operating a run" section, the connector docs bundle carries it, and
  every connector folds a workflow steer (`WORKFLOW_STEER`) into its agent instructions beside the
  mesh-first steer, so agents reach for a durable journalled run instead of improvising long
  coordination loops in their own context.

## 0.38.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a330c7: Managed Jcode seats launch on macOS and the BSDs again. Credential mirroring pins each parent
  directory so an ancestor swapped mid-walk cannot redirect a copy, mkdir, or unlink outside the
  private home, and the only pin the connector had was `/dev/fd/<fd>/<name>`, which needs Linux
  procfs traversal, so #1170 bounded managed seats to Linux to keep that guarantee.

  The pin now has a second mechanism with the same contract. macOS and the BSDs pin the parent as the
  process working directory: after `chdir`, a single-component name resolves from that directory's
  inode and no ancestor is walked again, which is the same guarantee `/dev/fd/<fd>/<name>` provides on
  Linux. `chdir` takes a path, so entry is verified rather than trusted: the entered directory's
  inode must equal the inode of the descriptor opened a moment before, which closes the window between
  the two. The previous working directory is restored on every exit, including the refusing ones.

  The Linux path is unchanged. The suite's TOCTOU battery previously stood down to eighteen
  unfailable `check(name, true)` cells off Linux; it now drives all of them on any POSIX platform,
  including the three controls that show the unpinned pattern still deletes and leaks outside the
  home. Two cells cover the working-directory pin's own failure modes.

  Windows is unchanged and still refused before launch: Jcode's released Harness API bridge is a
  Unix-socket surface.

### Patch Changes

- e2cba27: The Jcode MCP bridge entry is written `shared: true`, so the per-seat daemon pools one bridge process and reuses it across sessions. Under `shared: false` every subagent session spawned its own bridge and none stopped before seat teardown, so seats running repeated subagents accumulated bridge processes without bound. Pooling stays inside the seat: the daemon, its home, its socket, and its relay token are all private to the seat.

## 0.37.0

### Minor Changes

- 4feb60d: Jcode credential mirroring pins copy, mkdir, and unlink through one Linux `/dev/fd` parent walk, and names a refusal when that traversal is missing. A managed Jcode seat now launches on Linux only, so a macOS user loses managed seats.

### Patch Changes

- 1cd9e6b: Remove stale Jcode credential mirror files when their allowlisted sources disappear.
- 11be292: Deliver directed peer messages into an active Jcode turn through the recipient session's soft-interrupt queue, committing them only after the containing turn succeeds.
- 0660504: Steer directed Jcode inbound while the Harness session is busy even without a Cotal-owned drive, and publish automatic queue depth and age on presence activity.
- e703873: Report connector harness availability at manager boot and expose resolved binary paths in status.
- 0365fa1: Name Jcode model startup refusals and persist connector diagnostics in each managed seat home.
- d8b6e63: Refuse a `cotal_spawn` model pin the manager did not record, and name the recorded pin on the spawn result and orientation card so a dropped override cannot look like cross-vendor confirmation.

  A Jcode variant-tier refusal now names the requested model pin rather than the session default RuntimeInfo still reports after setModel.

- c11207f: Keep a Jcode mesh seat alive when the first private bridge replacement fails transiently by retrying launch and session attach inside one bounded recovery window, while refusing another launch unless the failed replacement is proven stopped and terminating immediately on permanent SDK refusals.
- b88edd9: Connectors declare `supportsToolListAnnounce` (default-deny). A connection-changing op against a connector that cannot announce a tool-list change fails loud, without naming harnesses in shared code.

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 4ef59c3: A spawned seat now receives a constructed environment (PATH/HOME/locale, the machine-wide COTAL\_\* knobs, connector-declared provider keys) instead of the manager's ambient environment. Host-session markers such as CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION no longer leak into seats and silently disable transcript saving. The Claude connector declares CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (and the rest of claude's documented credential set) so a container seat still authenticates; spawn.env remains the explicit opt-in for extra names, including a host marker a persona has chosen to receive.

### Patch Changes

- a93ef08: `--variant` now selects a Jcode seat's reasoning effort instead of failing loud.
  The connector declares `supportsModelVariant`, takes the tier from `--variant`
  or a persona's `variant:`, and the host applies it to the session after the
  model and before the seat's first turn — so no turn is ever served at an effort
  nobody chose.

  The tier is validated by Jcode, which owns the per-provider, per-model ladder
  and names the accepted set when it refuses; the connector keeps no copy of it.
  A rejected tier, or a model with no reasoning-effort surface, ends the launch
  rather than clamping to a neighbouring effort. Its public diagnostic is limited
  to the requested tier, effective model, fixed provider code, and a safely parsed
  accepted ladder, never arbitrary downstream error text. Omitting the variant
  keeps Jcode's own configured default.

  The mandatory `cotal_orientation` readiness proof now repeats once when Jcode's first turn ran
  against the pre-MCP tool snapshot. A second absence still refuses the launch; the retry is bounded
  and never advertises an agent whose mesh tools were not proven callable.

## 0.30.2

### Patch Changes

- 8d50f44: The jcode connector now handles macOS and BSD process-exit races during private-instance teardown
  without hiding operational `ps` failures. A failed per-PID inspection is treated as a vanished
  process only after an independent PID probe proves it no longer exists.
- dff171c: connector-jcode: a managed seat no longer updates its own binary

  Jcode's background updater restarts the process tree when it lands a release. That restart
  SIGTERMs the seat's TUI, which is the only connection the Jcode server counts as a client, and
  nothing re-attaches afterwards — so the server's idle reaper shuts the whole seat down five
  minutes later, mid-turn, with `exit code 1, signal 0` and no signal from the manager. The seat's
  version is now the operator's choice at spawn time and cannot change under a running agent.

## 0.30.1

## 0.30.0

### Patch Changes

- 36d23ed: A failed jcode turn is now retried with a growing delay and a give-up budget, instead of instantly
  and forever. A turn's batch is acked only on success, so a failure left the wake count positive and
  the `finally` re-drove the same batch with no pause and no limit, re-paying the full injection to
  the provider on every pass. Retries now start at one second, double to a one-minute ceiling, keep at
  most one timer in flight, and stop after eight consecutive failures with the batch left un-acked so
  it redelivers. A failing seat also reports `waiting` rather than `idle`, because a seat holding an
  un-acked batch and pacing a retry is not idle.
- b282f70: Honor a connector's declared startup readiness window and make Jcode provider launch refusals diagnosable without exposing private harness output.
- b69d2bb: Jcode now relays the advertised `cotal_inbox` `peek` argument while preserving its host-owned
  pull-only inbox scope. `peek: true` shows buffered quiet ambient without clearing it; explicit
  `peek: false` and omitted arguments retain the normal destructive pull.
- 9626206: The jcode connector now owns the full private-instance shutdown path instead of trusting mutable
  SDK registry PIDs. Each launch carries a random launch-bound identity and captures immutable process
  start tokens before teardown; a PID from `servers.json` or `active_pids` is signalled only when it
  matches that launch, so stale records can never kill an unrelated process tree. Shutdown stops the
  bridge first, waits through a bounded quiescence window for late daemon records, and then tears down
  the exact recorded or already-captured launch processes before the host returns.
- a7386cb: Keep a managed Jcode seat alive when a provider failure closes its private Harness API connection
  mid-turn. The connector now leaves the failed turn unacknowledged, makes one private replacement,
  reattaches the same owned session, and then resumes mesh delivery. A failed replacement or a second
  connection loss fails loud instead of retrying bridge launches without bound.
- 3443c57: Stabilize Jcode startup around asynchronous MCP registration: retry the mandatory orientation proof once, preserve loud refusal when it remains unavailable, open the foreground TUI during readiness, and issue the stale-orientation notice only after a completed mesh join.

## 0.28.0

### Patch Changes

- 5fc753f: A jcode seat now records which provider is actually carrying its model, and refuses a
  provider-prefixed model id at the launch boundary. The connector already refused to join under a
  model label it did not receive, but that guarantee stopped at the model: a seat could be truthfully
  labelled while its traffic was carried by a component nobody named, and `RuntimeInfo` already
  carried the provider and routes in the same response the model check reads. A `provider/model`
  specifier was forwarded verbatim to an endpoint that expects a bare id, so the refusal came back as
  `model_not_found` naming neither the connector nor the prefix; it is now refused where the accepted
  form can be named.
- bd4fb99: A restarted jcode seat now resumes the session it left instead of silently starting blank. The host
  called `createSession` unconditionally, so `cotal stop` followed by `cotal spawn` forked a new
  session and orphaned the existing transcript: the seat came back looking healthy while remembering
  nothing, and the TUI, which is spawned with `--resume`, showed an attaching human the very history
  the agent could not recall. The host now looks for a prior session in the seat's own home and
  attaches it, choosing conservatively: the session must declare this seat's working directory, must
  not be archived, and must carry a non-empty transcript. When nothing is resumable it starts fresh
  and says so, and when it does resume it does not re-send the persona briefing into a transcript that
  already opens with it.
